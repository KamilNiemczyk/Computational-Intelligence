Comment: Good job it didn’t cost Liverpool the 3 points. Genuine question though… does anything happen to the refs that made the decision?  
  
This is right at the start of the season, didn’t cost Liverpool 3 points and Liverpool are definitely not going to be in a relegation battle (you would think!).
  
But say this happened in another game and it costs a team 3 points, and potentially a Premier League spot… what happens?    
  
Seems that these ridiculous decisions only ever effect the club/player in question, even if it gets overturned.
Comment: Common sense prevails.
Comment: Football won today.
Comment: Cool. Now do Tomiyasu
Comment: It should never of been given one of the few ridiculous ones thrown around so far.
Comment: My reaction as a Newcastle fan: Bugger.

My reaction as a fan of the sport: Get in!
Comment: Ok cool.  Can we have an investigation into the PGMOL now please.
Comment: Well can we play with 12 men for 40 minutes against newcastle as a compensation then?XD
I mean since they've overturned it means they were wrong,and every wrongdoing must have a compensation XD
Comment: But did they get the apology! Lol. Seriously though justice has been done unfortunately for us Newcastle fans. 😄
Comment: Do I get my 3 points on fpl then?
Comment: They actually listened and rectified the mistake. Fair play
Comment: Now do Tim Ream
Comment: As a fan yeah I'm happy about it. As a football supporter, what the actual fuck are these officials up to...

Riddle me this: We're 37 games into the season, it's a tight neck & neck between whomever, let's say Arsenal & City for an unbiased example.. Odegard gets sent off. City score a winner after... City win the league......

These okes have no idea what they are doing. We're all here hoping for a fair competition and it's a pipe dream. They have fuckall clue and as long as this is the standard in "The best football league in Europe" league standings will not be an accurate reflection of a teams performance...

Might as well go watch golf or some other sport.
Comment: Does that mean I get my -2 points back in fantasy
Comment: Ok now do tomi
Comment: Howard Webb came in and said they were raising the standards for VAR intervention, ever since then VAR has been an absolute shit show, it wasn't great before, but since the "raising of the bar" it's 10x worse. This should 100% have been looked at by the referee, there's nothing wrong with telling the referee to go look at the screen and him sticking with his original decision, but it seems like that is VARs worst nightmare, so they're just avoiding telling the referee to go look unless they're 110% sure the ref is wrong. 

The last thing fans wanted was a lower bar for VAR intervention. Webb needs the sack
Comment: Isn’t that was VAR is for? Why are we making that decision now than in the moment with various professionals.
Comment: Does anyone know the total number of red cards that have been overturned in the Premier League since it's Inception?  Or since VAR was introduced in the 2019/20 season?

I did some searching around but no joy so far!  Thanks and cheers!
Comment: Good
Comment: Biggest problem is still how the ref and var ended up with the in-game conclusion that red was allright. Spineless, useless and knowledgeless var usage by the refs on field and infront of the monitor.

If they wont overturn wrong decisions to protect the refs integrity, then they achieve the opppsite. Why even bother.

Comment: Not particularly
Comment: Be the same as last season..Stay up on the last day and invade the pitch like they've won the league
Comment: I always root for fellow promotion clubs
Comment: Yep, I really want Everton to go down. Partly because I want to see the chaos and partly because they absolutely deserve it with how woefully mismanaged they've been.
Comment: The way Everton have acted today, diving every time they go in the box. And now this from Pickford and Mina. They deserve to go down. Don’t think it will happen now
Comment: The hate from all of you makes it ever more sweet… Enjoy another season of hating the club with the most top flight seasons ✌️
Comment: Nah mate Everton must stay in premier league
Comment: Not me, I have plenty of bluenose family and friends. Plus, I'd be gutted with no derbies to look forward to.
Comment: Not at all. I want Everton to stay up. They have enough of a shit time having Liverpool as their neighbours.

And Leicester can fuck off after that FA Cup win. Amartey especially.
Comment: NOT ME BOI


YOU WON'T BE CATCHING ME ROOTING FOR BOURNEMOUTH
Comment: Have friends who support Everton so hoping they stay in

That being said, management will learn nothing from this, and it'll be the same again next year where going one league down could mean the actual obliteration of the club 

[Which makes me feel like that Jesse Pinkman meme](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Flsv1xLHQbsMPUGoLcMWElmkr20=/3x0:1435x806/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49420019/ChrisTillmanIsAJerk.0.0.png)
Comment: I feel a strong sense of pride and unity that whilst the rest of the league wanted the Ev to go down, the majority of our fans were actually happy for them to stay up. League wouldn’t be the same without them
Comment: How'd that work out for you?
Comment: Would rather see the back of Leicester
Comment: Everton won as I had anticipated.
Comment: Unlucky

Comment: Support for a holiday resort club over an actual relevant one? 

Nah lad.
Comment: Always....
Comment: I was wondering what they'd do if they got a corner. Send the keeper up or not?

I mean if he scores you have a new rivalry forever.

But you don't have to, you can just pack up and go on holiday.

Comment: There was contact but it was so exaggerated by Szobo there. If it was any other team i’d be fuming too…but it’s my team so i’m just laughing at the shithousery from the lad
Comment: Feel that the macallister red was a yellow at best. Looked like for me it was boot to boot, yes studs on the bournemouth players boot, but still contesting for the ball
Comment: Seems to be a 50/50 split in here of people who think it was a dive and people who think it was a soft pen, maybe it wasnt a clear and obvious error then
Comment: I mean i get that other big team fans don't want Pool to win (same here), but the defender clearly made contact with him so even tough it was soft, the ref had to give it.
Comment: That red card any better?
Comment: Liverpool fan, both were awful decisions

I hate diving for the record, but players are almost forced to dive to get decisions. It was a foul, and if players stay on their feet when they are fouled, they don't get the decision. If refs were better and gave decisions when players try to stay on their feet we'd see less diving
Comment: Var looked apparently
Comment: I mean, it’s a really soft penalty for sure but it’s hard not to give. 

Defender was silly enough to fall for Szoboszlai faint into the box. You hate to see it but he did make contact, and would be hard to overturn from that alone.
Comment: Left his foot in. There was contact. 🤷‍♂️
Comment: That’s the softest red I have ever seen awarded
Comment: Not worst than a fucking straight red. Stop fucking crying.
Comment: Man Utd fans should be the last ones to question referees decisions
Comment: I mean the guy put a foot in...
Comment: some salty fannies in here
Comment: Not a penalty. Not a red. Fuck the referees.
Comment: It's a pen all day lol I'd say that even if it was another team! Szobo is looking for it and going down easily but nonetheless it's still a pen
Comment: Wonder if you'll post about the absurd red card? Probably not
Comment: Agree completely. Embarrassing. Worst of all the Bournemouth keeper gets booked for claiming it was a dive.... which it was.
Comment: What can we do as fans? I’m sick of it.
Comment: Please any app that I can watch the epl for free?

Comment: Well done Bournemouth. Well earned summer break starts now. Like right now please.
Comment: I think Leicester is definitely going down this year. They are terrible
Comment: The fact that their own manager thought they were going down at the start of the season is probably the biggest hint about how big a deal this is. They've been more or less safe for so long we've all forgotten.
Comment: I have a gut feeling that Leeds will beat West Ham and draw with Tottenham, leading to safety and Everton to go down
Comment: What a job Gary O'Neill has done deserves a lot of credit after they lost at West ham I thought they were nose diving to relegation.
Comment: Yeah, fair play to Bournemouth. 

They have taken their chances really well when they have come along
Comment: Who would have thought that after the 9-0 against Liverpool.
Comment: Congratulations... Please stay in touch next year. Let us know what it's like....
Comment: Up the cherries!!!!! I’m just looking forward to our new owners Bill Foley and Michael B Jordan to start finishing our training complex and possible new stadium to lay foundations for the future.
Comment: I could not be happier! Thought we would have finished 19th in all honesty
Comment: Bournemouth securing safety with 2 matches left to play while Leicester are just 1 loss away (depends on Everton) from relegation was not on my bingo card at the midway point of the season.
Comment: Best thing about them this season, you see them have a couple of bad results in the last 25 games, and the players didn't look rattled or bothered. Conceded a heartbreaking last min goal vs arsenal, things like that can make the head go down and not come back up, but those players just seemed to carry on as normal, and when a similar scenario happens vs spurs they score straight away.


Bringing neto in was a genius move. As an irishman I wanted Travers to do well but hes looked massively out of his depth
Comment: Bournemouth had some really good players that no one in the media or most fans saw coming. Every time I watch Bournemouth Billing is playing amazing, solanke even if he doesn’t score plays his role, and Outarra is fun to watch
Comment: Sad to see Leicester going down after what they achieved in the last few years. But its really not that surprising if you look closer.

Their recruitment has been shocking. Seemed to be more interested in finding more hidden gem types than actually investing the ridiculous fees they garnered for Maguire, Mahrez, Kante, Fofana, etc. (£250million for these 4 alone) into established high level players who could have solidified them as a team that competes for Europe every year.

It was clear as well last night that the players have given up. I doubt Dean Smith ever thought he could keep them up. Was probably just hoping he could get them to put up enough of a fight to impress some other teams that would be on the hunt for a new manager.
Comment: Leicester and leeds tbh
Comment: As a Leeds fan I have only one thing to say:




FfffffffffFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Comment: [RIP to every youtuber football "pundits" out there with their predictions](https://twitter.com/afcbournemouth/status/1657769223303712772)
Comment: Nice detailed table and description. Have to appreciate the efforts in collating the information.
Comment: Bournemouth and Fulham proved me wrong
Comment: Bournemouth should pay us back for all we've done for them this season with a win against Man United

Comment: Newcastle fan. I’m very happy with 6th this season given how bad our injury issues have been, alongside our star signing (Tonali) missing nearly the entire season due to suspension. I think Eddie Howe and the team have handled themselves very well and deserve credit for what they’ve done. I also think that with our squad depth at the moment, I think Europa League is more our level than Champions League. We should never have been in a position to be starting 17 year old Lewis Miley against the likes of PSG, Dortmund and AC Milan - despite him handling it so well!
Comment: Wolves! After all the talent we lost, bringing in a new manager and being under financial scrutiny, if you had told me we’d be in the middle of the pack, I would’ve said, sign me up! Now if we can just hold on to O’Neil…
Comment: I am happy! The way we play, it’s surprising we ever got to 40 points.
Comment: Spurs fans who aren’t happy with how this season has gone are just asinine. 

Sold Kane the day before the season starts, tons of good/young signings and currently 5th. You’ve got your keeper and 4 defensive starters lined out for years to come. Before the season started, I would’ve been happy with 7th, a couple fun moments and a thorough plan for additional signings during the summer window. 

Run in to end the season was always going to be tough but I’m not discouraged by it. Very happy with current outlook.
Comment: As a spurs fan, if I was told at the start of the season we’d finish 5th/6th with no Kane and a new manager, I’d have taken that all day long. 
There is disappointment in our performances post the first chelsea game, but overall, can’t really complain.
Comment: I wouldn’t say I’m happy, but I feel a lot better than I did at the end of 2023.
Comment: Heyyyyyy

With our points deduction, squad shuffle, Kenright dying, ownership limbo, and all that bullshit…finishing 15th is pretty good
Comment: Uhm Chelsea should be happy considering how badly they started
Comment: Everyone thought that when Kane left, we'd finish outside the top ten and become a mid table team.

New manager who doesn't know the league and we're 5th. There is the occasional sign that you can see what Ange wants from this team too. I'm happy with it, I would have taken it at the beginning of the season
Comment: Chelsea fan here. Mildly pleased with current position and would be incredible to see us get 6th.

If you told me at the start of the season we would be fighting for 6th, I would’ve been upset, for sure. But given the injuries and squad shuffling, I’m happy with where we are now.
Comment: if you would have said we were finishing third at the beginning of the year, I'd have been pretty happy

so... kinda us?
Comment: Wolves fan. 

We’ve had a great season considering the mess we were in after the summer. Not flirted with relegation looked competitive in most matches, scored a ton of goals compared to previous years, and got a few top 6 scalps to add to the collection. 

Now if we could get those VAR decisions right I’d be absolutely ecstatic chasing a European spot
Comment: Liverpool, absolutely. 

Only got Europa League last season.

Got CL this season while also bedding in a whole new midfield and trying out lots of promising youngsters. 

Not bad.
Comment: Tbh, with the season we WERE having I have to say normally I wouldn't be happy how it ended.

But seeing it's rebuild year I think it's pretty decent ending (probably) at third place.
Comment: Spurs

At the beginning of the season with Kane leaving, I thought we were going to be midtable. It seems bleak right now but remove the overperformance at the start of the season, I’m pretty happy for a European spot.
Comment: I'm delighted with ours, if we're not in Europe at all next season it means there's less opportunities for us to completely embarrass ourselves
Comment: Palace fan.

I can only dream of a season with Eze and Olise together for 30 games or more
Comment: As a Liverpool fan 100% yes. Coming off last season I was honestly expecting another poor season where we might finish in the top 6 if Villa and others kept improving, which Villa have. To have been in the title race that long was amazing an getting over the last few weeks disappointment its hard not to look back and think its been a very successful season all things considered. Full midfield rebuild including Endo who was lambasted when we bought him after the Caicedo and Lavia farces. Losing Matip for the full season and have Quansah step in so seamlessly, same as Bradley at RB. Winning the Carabao Cup the way we did. All whilst playing under the shadow of Klopps announcement since January/February. Can't complain and excited to see where Slot can take us next season and beyond. Apart from that I think you can maybe add Chelsea to the list with how they have pulled it back over the last weeks/months.
Comment: Newcastle. 

Pretty happy all things considered. Atrocious injury record to a lot of key players (same as other teams I know, I’m talking about my team, not comparing), and we had a couple of REALLY rough runs of form mid season. We’ve had a slightly dodgy year in some respects but with 2 games left we’re in the drivers seat to finish 6th, which all things considered is probably about where we’d have predicted we’d come at the start. 

Somehow if results go insanely in our favour there’s a really really outside chance we finish 5th, which is one spot lower than last year, and we’ve missed our keeper, talisman RB and main CBs for long sections of the year and our defence has been honestly disgusting. Crazy really. 

AND we played in the Champions League this year! 

Decent.
Comment: Chelsea. But context is important here.

Comment: This is ridiculous

Obviously three hammerings in a row is pretty awful by any standard but look at their fixtures and the quality of their squad. Just 4 games into the season and having City, Arsenal and Liverpool is ridiculous for a team of that quality. Parker had no chance.

They even beat Villa on the opening day too
Comment: Very harsh this early on. Beat villa then got handed Arsenal City and Liverpool. What 3 points from those games surely were the best outcome possible.
Comment: It’s Dyche time baby. Can you imagine his joy at having Keifer-Moore and Solanke up front?
Comment: Reading into the statement I’m guessing it’s not a results based firing?


“However, in order for us to keep progressing as a team and a Club as a whole, it is unconditional that we are aligned in our strategy to run the club sustainably. We must also show belief in and respect for one another.“


This strikes me as them taking exception to his comments or more stuff behind closed doors
Comment: As a Watford fan who’s experienced a manger being sacked after 4 games into the new season, Bournemouth fans, you’ll be returning to the championship next year im afraid
Comment: How many points did they expect from those 4 games
Comment: His sacking wasn't about result's, it was the comments he made about the club. Obviously stuff going on behind the scenes with Scott and the owner
Comment: Brilliant advertising from Bournemouth to whoever their new manager is going to be.

"Dare say you want new players and we'll fucking sack you"
Comment: BREAKING NEWS: Bournemouth has been relegated from the premier league. The earliest relegation in league history too, after just four games.
Comment: Pathetic.

They have spent nothing and play in the Prem with a stadium that holds 11,379. I think the owners/board need to remind themselves they are punching well above their weight even being in this league.

I hope they go down.
Comment: Staggering how many people don't read the statement. They've made it crystal clear it's nothing to do with results and everything to do with his comments after the game, he's not on board with their policy and strategy so he goes, it's as simple as that yet people continue to attribute it to their results.
Comment: I’m getting sick of these teams that piss the championship but have no ambition in the prem. There needs to be some double relegation rule if a club keeps yoyoing really
Comment: Nobody seems to understand why they've sacked him. His job is to manage the first team, part of which is motivating your players. Hard to do that if you're constantly crying to the media that your current crop is nowhere near good enough, even if it's true. You do that in private to the owner, if he says tough shit, you either get on with it or leave. In public you have to stand with your team, or you've got no chance of them standing with you.
Comment: Damn I had money on Gerrard being the first to go.

Guessing this was because Parker was constantly saying they needed new signings urgently which I viewed more to be a cry for help than anything else. If I'm right in thinking they did back him a lot in January but not since promotion. If he just looks to the other promoted teams he will see Fulham being backed well and Forest having a whole new squad, it's no surprise he wanted a little more.

If it's based on results then thats beyond ridiculous. They've done well to come out of those fixtures with 3 points.
Comment: Wasn’t bloody expecting Parker to be sacked this early on the season but he spoke the truth in regards to not being backed in the transfer window. I’m hoping the board can back our new manager even if we sign a player or two on deadline day.
Comment: Very harsh considering their first four opponents
Comment: Wonder if Big Sam has his phone switched on?
Comment: And they thought Frank would be the first sacking this season….
Comment: This is a disgrace. From what I’ve heard it’s about his comments after the game but I haven’t heard any outrageous comments? All I heard him say was that they were “underequipped for this level” by which I assumed he meant they can’t be expected to go to Anfield and compete with the squad they have. I’d love if people could tell me some other things he said that were controversial. 

Results-wise, they’ve not even been that bad. They were handed an ugly set of fixtures to start the season but Parker managed to get a win on the board against Villa and also got them through in the League Cup against Norwich.
Comment: Speaking with a Bournemouth fan, and makes it sound like the long term plan was infrastructure and eventually a bigger stadium for increased revenue being put before squad investment as the money is lost after a few years.

Parker has done bits in the media saying teams no good and wanting more players, so is incompatible.

Comment: The board's loss. This is on par with Tuchel being sacked by Chelsea a week after the transfer deadline. O'Neil deserves better than this idiotic and disrespectful decision.
Comment: “How dare he keep them up against all odds and without putting unrealistic expectations on the board or playing staff. What an arsehole. Sack him,” said nobody.
Comment: Probably disagreement between him and the board or, they weren’t happy with their end of season form. Baffling though
Comment: Why is Jesse Marsch the flavour of the month for every managerial post that becomes available? I’m not sure I saw much in what he did while at Leeds to warrant his reputation.
Comment: It feels shocking on the face but it’s a defensible move. Bournemouth got the results they needed but their actual performance was pretty bad and they kinda lucked out with so many bad teams in the league. 

We obviously won’t know if this is the correct move, but I see why they did it.
Comment: My jaw literally dropped when I read that, absolutely shocking decision.
Comment: Shock, but its not like he set the world on fire - he kept them up which was the goal. He'll be fine and probably end up at Luton/Sheff Utd once they sack their manager for a bad start next season! 

They must have somebody lined up. American owners so everyone thinks Jesse Marsch. We'll find out soon I guess - probably Potter.
Comment: Leeds should be looking at this guy
Comment: Looks like the board wants to bring in a bigger name which probably won't end well
Comment: They'd give away gold if it was in a paper bag.
Comment: Bournemouth played some good football at times, o'neil did well to keep them up disgraceful to be sacked.
Comment: Another set of morons in charge of a football club. He did an amazing job at Bournemouth. Especially after Parker came out and sucked any confidence they may have had right out of the team at the beginning of the season
Comment: Shocking decision, hopefully he can get another club either in premier or championship and prove these owners wrong
Comment: I’d have him at palace
Comment: I hope we get to see him with some more resources next year in the prem
Comment: I hope they get relegated for this . No offense meant to Bournemouth fans .
Comment: Realistically it’s because they want to go up a level. Unfortunately for him it’s a day after the news broke of a Premier League manager being questioned for rape so that’s going to stick on his name for a bit. 
There’s also a rumour that it’s because a video is about to be leaked by the press of him having sexual intercourse with a melon but that obviously isn’t true 😂.
Comment: At this point it’s basically in the contract of any PL manager that they’re being paid to be the scapegoat. I have to imagine that they know that going in. 

To SACK (not mutually part ways blah blah blah) a manager after the season result Bournemouth just got is incomprehensible. It’s like they planned to get relegated and got confused when they stayed up.
Comment: Jesse Marsch? are you serious?
Comment: Fucking madness

Comment: Spurs fans genuinely thought Bissouma was a better player
Comment: Declan Rice, we paid half price
Comment: When Rice was first getting hype my opinion was he’s a centre back trying to be a midfielder. Well he has made me look a mug. what a player. Forget Gerrard and Lampard, Rice and Bellingham will actually compliment each other and could be world beaters for England.
Comment: Good to see him playing for a club that's unlocking his full potential, you'll see people harping on here about how we all know he's a great player, and the media are only praising him now he's at a big club, but he's really stepped up a level 

15 G+As in the league this season. 

The 3rd most among midfielders in the league this season and more than

Maddison (11)
Bernardo (11)
Paqueta (10)
Kulusevski (9)
Szoboszlai (5)
Grealish (4)
Comment: We’ve been telling you guys for the past two years he is the best dm in the world. Called us crazy for asking for 100m. Now you know that was a discount.
Comment: What 100M actually looks like
Comment: As a spurs fan I fucking hate how good he is
Comment: Signing of their season for sure !
Comment: He's flying like a butterfly in the sun
Comment: Blossoming? They're a little late
Comment: Blossoming?! Buddy, he is already a Fruit! Not in the homosexual sense. Though, who knows with this sub!
Comment: I mean him at the start of the season has been incredible and we are lucky to have him. Add that to the fact he's actively improving, as in moving into the 8, carrying the ball, taking our corners over Martinelli or Trossard and yeah he's just that good. 

Rice and Rodri are the only two that should be in conversation for the player of the season. And whoever of the two wins the league deserves it. 

It's great that he's 'blossoming' into his role too, was a West Ham reject when we picked him up and now look at him.

Comment: Not really. If you look at the stats, Caicedo is better. Imagine him with a healthy team around to actually play with.
Comment: Hope arse enjoy another trophyless season

Comment: The answer is simple: Bournemouth are currently 5 points off 7th place (6 points really though if you factor in their goal difference) and 7th will almost certainly be high enough to qualify for Europe next season. Whilst it's highly unlikely that Bournemouth will get up to 7th place, until it's a mathematical impossibility their dreams are still alive.
Comment: 5 points off 7th, which is Conference League. Unlikely they do it but realistically if Chelsea, United and Newcastle keep tripping up, they could take it to the final day.
Comment: Yeah they are and I am also chasing Jennifer Lawrence.
Comment: They might make UEFA Europa Conference Extension Addition league. It’s obscure, you probably aren’t hip enough to know about it.
Comment: They sacked their manager and got a better one.
Comment: They technically have a shot to make it to the Conference League. But saying they are “Chasing Europe is a bit of an exaggeration. They’re 3 points behind West Ham, whose own European aspirations are a long shot.

The last two spots will likely go to the best two of Newcastle, Man United, Brighton, or Chelsea.
Comment: They play on the front foot and have an effective striker
Comment: If Manchester City win the FA Cup and Liverpool finish Top 5, then 8th place becomes the Conference League spot
Comment: Tiny outside chance 8th gets Conference league?
Comment: They have had really smart recruitment in recent seasons and Iriola has taken them to another level.

Solanke's form and ability to stay fit has done them wonders.

They also play attacking football and don't sit and park the bus.

Comment: Tbf, villa were bought in July 2018 in the Championship, 2 year promotion plan worked. 5 year plan to get back to Europe has worked/is working. It can be done, I mean why not? And why not have goals, they're playing well atm, if they could consistently do that is it so alien they could get a conference place?

Comment: RemindMe! 5years
Comment: Settle down
Comment: These "within x years" goals always seem silly to me. Like they could do it, and aiming for Europe is a good goal to have. But they could do everything right and still fail because other teams just did better.

At least it's a lot more reasonable than China's win the World Cup by 2050 goal I suppose.
Comment: So they don't care about trophies?

Comment: H
Comment: Preparing for Solanke to leave?
Comment: Is the pronunciation of his name as unfortunate as I'm thinking it is?

Comment: I didn’t see much contact between the players.
Comment: Really? Thought Silva got to the ball first. Obviously extremely aggressive challenge and not the smartest move to make with the game tied
Comment: I’m not sure if it was right or wrong but we needed a win so bad 75% of me doesn’t care. However, the other 25% of me thinks they could have spent more time in the VAR review.
Comment: It was a great tackle.
Comment: I was really unsure, could've gone either way for me
Comment: That was a clean clear tackle lmfao 

This is understandable because you don’t see good defending as a United fan

All of our defenders are better than yours
Comment: Who’s the referee, Attwell?
Comment: I just knew that we will be the team to lose against Chelsea, they probably won't win another but ehhh alright well done Chelsea
Comment: chelsea have not conceded a penalty once this season somehow
Comment: Completely robbed. That was stunningly bad.
Comment: People forget their score wouldve only went up by 1 making it still a 2-3 defeat.

Comment: I'd heard big things about him before he arrived and was excited to see it work out. Looked maybe a step too far at the beginning but the faith was maintained and Bournemouth have benefitted very well from it. Nice to see and I'm pleased Gary O'Neil got a good job from it too. Surprisingly nice ending for all involved so far.
Comment: This is fantastic news for the league as much as for Bournemouth. His team plays some good football. Really happy to read this news.
Comment: Haven't managed to get the smile off my face all day. Ludicrously happy right now.
Comment: When they gave O'Neill the sack I thought they would risk going down. O'Neill is a very good manager and has brought an injury stricken Wolves through a season where they also lost loads of players.

Bournemouth were also just a bit shit when Iraola first came in, they looked genuinely worse than Luton and felt like a free three points. Especially after the Doku game. I thought they'd keep Luton up. 

But then the rest of the coaching staff came and Iraola has turned them right the way around and are one of the best playing teams. 

He's a great service to his club and makes the league better, glad to see him stay.
Comment: Great for Bournemouth. With the Glasner news I was wondering if Bayern would come knocking. They’ll probably go after De Zerbi now. Three, maybe four coaches and counting have turned them down.
Comment: I was outraged when they binned O’Neil for him, so yeah, I’m stupid aren’t I
Comment: i recon with the season they had this season under iraola they will push for europe he’s underestimated everyone and defied the odds of taking bournemouth down to the championship.
Comment: Well deserved! Good for him, bad for us!
Comment: He deserves it plenty of people before the season as one of the favorites for relegation.

Comment: The decision on managers aside, Bournemouth has scored the lowest amount of goals this season so far (5) and have conceded 18 (only Sheffield and Burnley have conceded more). So yeah, I think they might be relegated if their team continue to struggle to score goals.
Comment: I'm guessing they were trying to take the next step up, like when Southampton sacked Adkins for Pochettino. Obviously that decision worked out for the Saints, but it was a huge risk and sometimes risks don't pay off.

Also haven't Bournmouth spent a ton of money on injured players? I imagine they'll improve once they recover
Comment: It sure looks like. Looked for all the world that this would finally be the year Everton get caught out, but Bournemouth are doing their damndest to make sure that doesn’t happen. Much like Sheff Utd doing their hardest to make sure Luton aren’t the worst team.
Comment: You lost me at Gary O'Neil is a great manager
Comment: We have had a riddiculous start to the season it terms of the teams we played and I was still confident, today has just irritated me. 

I know a lot of people want to see us get relegated because of the manager situation. But how can we say Gary would have done better with the games we have had? Just because he kept us up last season? We wasn't great then either.

We tried to move forward as a club to try and stay in such a tough league as this is by getting a highly rated manager from Europe to help going forward, may not have worked out so far, but who knows by January it could work out. After calming down at this point I am once again confident that we will get more confidence and get good results.
Comment: In our defence we’ve played West Ham,Liverpool,Tottenham,Brentford, Chelsea, Brighton,Arsenal, and Everton so it hasn’t been an easy start.
Comment: half of the wolves fan wanted his head before the man city game
Comment: Bournemouth look dead and buried already I can't see them winning enough games to survive. Sacking the coach is inevitable.
Comment: I hope so because that was quite a dick move.
Comment: They look so bad
Comment: Yep

Burnley or Luton are delighted to see him at Wolves, there was a reason everyone thought Bournemouth would be relegated last season, and we are seeing it right now. 

Gary O' Neill is not the only but the biggest reason they weren't in a relegation battle. I thought Wolves would go down before he went there, now they look mid table.

No disrespect to Andoni Iraola, it's a hard job but I don't think he will have Bournemouth near or above 15th.
Comment: i was told bournemouth was building this amazing squad and was laughed at for saying they would go down this year lol
Comment: We thought our current manager was the better option but our football under Gary O’Neil wasn’t great so it’s too early to tell if it was the correct decision.
Comment: Wow these comments have aged so poorly…
Comment: They’re by far the worst team we’ve faced this season, we looked like we could’ve scored 8 there last week. I think them and the 3 promoted teams (and maybe Everton) are the relegation scrap this season. They’ve only really won points off each other so far too.
Comment: Bournemouth were bottom of the expected points table last season. While there are sustainable ways to outperform expected points, there is no evidence they were such a team, and instead they were likely just lucky.

This isn't to say Gary O'Neill was bad by the way, their squad was and is poor by Premier League standards - he did a solid enough job and got a bit fortunate.
Comment: For any of the teams already in the division to be relegated they need one of the promoted teams to step up, and none of them look capable of doing that.
Comment: I certainly hope so. Got in trouble for saying that around here, seems Bournemouth fans are convinced he over-performed and Iraola is the way to go. 🤷‍♂️
Comment: Bournemouth fans keep justifying it because they no longer play shit football apparently
Comment: Gary O’Neil is not a great manager and was not sacked for no reason. All the underlying information showed he/Bournemouth were very lucky to get some of their wins last season and their staying in the league was not deserved based on them not creating enough and conceding too many. The board recognised this and quite rightly replaced him. 

Sure the new guys been terrible but that doesn’t make O’Neil a “great manager”.

Comment: I'm not following Spanish football that much, but heard that Iraola's job was much appreciated in Rayo. To be fair, expected him in much bigger club this season. Maybe even Conference/Europe League level. That's big suprise to me.
Comment: Everyone who criticized Oneill’s sacking celebrating this hire lmao
Comment: Great appointment. Impressed last season with Vallecano, should’ve been at leads last season but club blocked him. Will be interesting to see how he adjusts
Comment: Well that was a quick turn around the board must be willing to invest more into the squad under Iraola. The prem is the toughest challenge In the world.
Comment: Thought the sacking was harsh originally but this looks to be a really good appointment for Bournemouth
Comment: No disrespect to this guy because I don't know that much about him apart from the fact that they finished 11th/12th two years in a row. However, he has to be something else if the club is to justify sacking O'Neil for a guy who has never managed in the PL. This is actually worse than I thought; O'Neil sacked not for Potter but for a guy who has never managed in the PL and so is inexperienced with the pace and ruthlessness of the PL.
Comment: That's a great move by AFC..
Comment: Nycfc legend
Comment: I think Iraola is a good hire. Took a team that was on a less than shoestring budget who was all but guaranteed to go down and had them fighting for European qualification. I think he would fit Bournemouth well if he can repeat his success with Rayo.
Comment: Pissed that Celtic didn’t appoint him
Comment: Shit cunts sacking there manager like that ducking 6AM phone call
Comment: The Spanish managers taking over English football.
Comment: I remember him as a player. Time flies.

Comment: Parker masterclass

Gotten them top without even a single kick of the ball
Comment: Also Brentford and Villa in the UCL🤩
Comment: They aren't really I know I will get slammed since so many people will know this but they count the team in alphabetical order at the start of the season when there is no results.🙂
Comment: Give it until the end of June and Arsenal would of found a way to get into 5th place.
Comment: Can’t believe they finally did it
Comment: There's one every year...
Comment: United actually did after 1 game last season. That turned out well...
Comment: Strictly speaking the should be 2nd. They are Athletic Football Club Bournemouth, that comes AFTER Arsenal alphabetically.
Comment: Arsenal can't even be first alphabetically 🥱.

Comment: Humongous game for Poch tomorrow.  Really good chance to connect with the fans by ending the season on a high. Anyway, as the article says, it'll be interesting to see whether Chelsea can cut through their defensive block regardless of whichever structure they go for.

Comment: 100% a handball. Officiating is absolutely diabolical this season, and var has not helped.
Comment: Definitely a handball, you can see Kehrer use his body to deflect the ball into a direction.


As a West Ham fan I'm delighted it stood, we can't finish our own goals...

If it was against us, I'd be furious!
Comment: Correction: it’s not a volleyball “spike” , it would be a volleyball “dig”
Comment: And another poor VAR decision in the match 🤦🏼‍♂️
Comment: WTF was that goal.  Thats clear volleyball pass.  He did that knowingly.  This is not right.
Comment: Mike Dean was on VAR... that explains **everything.**
Comment: I still don't understand why Westham's first goal stands.
Comment: Chop all premier league players arms off.


They get paid enough, don't need em.
Comment: That’s disgraceful decision. Kehrer basically deflected the ball and changed the trajectory of the ball to set up Zouma. Might not be intentional from Kehrer but goal should’ve never given.
Comment: What's funny was that even commentary was in silence for a moment when it was not given.
Comment: Never mind the worst decision this season, I reckon that's the worst one ever. By some distance. The ball only goes in that direction because it bounces upwards off his arm. If his arm isn't there, the ball bounces downwards.

When did the, admittedly also rubbish 'any touch of the arm at any point in the build up' rule get changed? But even that's irrelevant compared to this.
Comment: Made worse with their penalty at the end. Especially when a Westham player handled it in the area 5 minutes before and nothing given.  


Liverpool vs Arsenal - no pen  


Fulham this weekend - pen  


Westham tonight - pen  


These referees are just making it up as they go along to benefit their bets. Beyond corrupt, worse than the Italian match fixing a decade or 2 ago.
Comment: The rule is about accidental Handballs preceding a goal. There was nothing accidental about that. Wtf
Comment: Did Moyes mention Specsavers again or did he keep quiet as another decision goes his way?
Comment: The usual… Been couple of years in place now and still no improvement
Comment: They should stop talking about intentions. If it hits the hand it is a handball simple.
Comment: I don't understand how they gave this one but disallowed the rashford one a few weeks ago the refs need changing its not var that's the issue it's the ones controlling it
Comment: Getting totally fed up watching this sort of crap now. 

If the poor standards of refereeing is helping to decide the winner of a game then something is entirely broken in the league. 

I have no dog in the fight for either side in tonight’s game but every single bloody week recently it seems like the main talking point isn’t the action in the actual game anymore.
Comment: That wasn't a goal imo, but there seemed to be a handball inside Bournemouth's penalty area earlier that wasn't even reviewed too, so either I didn't see it right or the refs are smoking crack.
Comment: Screwed by VAR. Doesn’t change how bad we’ve played for the first 45 though

Comment: You'll never sing that
Comment: With injuries the way they have been at Chelsea the last year I can see them increasing theirs
Comment: Apparently Bournemouth's stadium is the most accessible in the league. People who've been, how accurate is this do you reckon?
Comment: I’m genuinely shocked to see the likes of Bournemouth and to a lesser extent Anfield so high up on these lists when they are fundamentally old structures (even if Anfield has been largely redeveloped). 

Makes you wonder what the likes of Spurs, Arsenal and more to the point West Ham (which was built with public money for the olympics) aren’t topping these lists with much more modern stadia.
Comment: As an Arsenal fan, I have never been able to get a wheelchair accessible away ticket for Bournemouth. They must have low capacity for away fans. The best facilities I’ve seen are at the Etihad after Arsenal.
Comment: Bit unfair to mark Fulham down for the parking one. They offer a free shuttle bus. There is no parking at all at the ground even the players have to park at the boys school.
Comment: All in percentages.
1% of 20,000 vs 0.5% of 60,000 means the latter has more seats (200 vs 300) in actual numbers.
Statistical manipulation at its finest

Comment: Are ticket prices that one can actually afford included in the requirements?
Comment: It's a shame that we're the bottom of the list. With Kenilworth road, as much as we love it, it's not exactly hard to see why. The plan for power court has been to incorporate far more and far better spaces for anyone with a disability. 

It's a really good showing from Bournemouth to be top of this though.

And we have literally no parking let alone disabled spots. The best proper, non street parking, is probably either the station or the conservative club at beech hill.
Comment: This is the first time I have ever heard the term "sensory suite" 
Does anyone have any experience with using one?
Comment: Our stadium is pretty accessible to be honest mate.
Comment: And the most fragile, apparently
Comment: Wonder why
Comment: Their goals seem to be the most accessible to opposing teams
Comment: As a % of overall seats it's not even close.
Comment: Luton in last. I wonder why..
Comment: No it isnt....unless of course your talking wheelchair accessible.....which stands at 0.69% of capacity...and man City ranks 6th

Comment: Would definitely be interested to see how this unfolds. Bournemouth seem to be doing pretty good right now, but as a neutral loved seeing Bielsa in English football.
Comment: We treated him terribly in the end. Vengeance is stalking us.
Comment: Leeds fans hyperventilating right now
Comment: Bournemouth with Bielsaball? Subscribed
Comment: This would be an intriguing appointment
Comment: All 5 bournemouth fans are buzzing
Comment: Would be interesting to say the least, I'd quite like to see it
Comment: Not a chance. He might win the championship with Bournemouth, would need half a season to impart his wisdom and by then they’re relegated
Comment: He won't accept
Comment: O neill is doing well, let him stay on
Comment: I'd stick with O'Neil for now, he's doing a great job, although if they could get Bielsa that would be amazing for them
Comment: Please don't do it Marcelo. You're too good for Bournemouth.
Comment: Vamos Bournemouth Carajo...
Comment: o neil was sacked?
Comment: Interesting proposition.
Comment: What an Upgrade after that shit cunt Parker!
Comment: Wait, I hadn’t even realised Bournemouth hadn’t hired anyone yet. Didn’t Parker get sacking August???
Comment: Bournemouth play Leeds on the 35th game of the season. Scenes if Bielsa relegates Leeds?
Comment: Sounds like a recipe for disaster surely?
Comment: This has to be bullshit. He's nuts

Comment: It’s wild that Pep had Jesus for years and never got anything like this out of him.  Dude is a beast.
Comment: People need to start putting respect on Gabriel Jesus' name. He's a world class striker in the same bracket as the other world class goalscorers in the Premier League. Got goals in him, whether he's scoring them, or contributing to them via assists.
Comment: gabriel jesus is a beast, but the way xhaka and zinchenko play football together is amazing to watch.
Comment: This Gabriel Jesus truly is a whole different machine of a player. His run at the defense made the goal out of absolutely nothing
Comment: These Arsenal fans don't stop singing. I love it
Comment: Arsenal fans are bouncing, don’t blame them
Comment: Jesus is simply stunning.
Comment: Jesus holy shit
Comment: TEQUILA!
Comment: Bournemouth look very limited

Comment: Feel like he’s starting to find his flow at the club.
Comment: 5 in the last 5.  Great to see him finally finding form and synergy with Johnson!
Comment: Pru Pru.
Comment: Best Brazilian striker right now is and it’s not even close!
Comment: went from 0 in 35 to 5 in 5, ridiculous improvement
