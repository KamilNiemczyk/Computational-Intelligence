Comment: Happy to see Moyes win a trophy, also happy to see Bowen grab the winner.

Well played lads!
Comment: What a great game. Great to see Moyes finally win a major trophy too, his career has warranted it.

Never understood the apprehensiveness over the introduction of this competition, it has been great to watch - beats watching the European powerhouses dunk on the minnows in the champions league.
Comment: Cheers Hammers! The wait is over. Massive congratulations! 

Props to Moyesie too.. Been some shite years for him after 2013 yet he’s built himself back up. Credit where it’s due.
Comment: Honestly really happy for them. You could see how much it meant to them. Exept that dickhead who threw stuff on the pitch.
Comment: First Premier League team to win the Europa Conference League!!!!
Comment: Italian clubs could lose three European finals this year.
Comment: Congratulations West Ham! Really happy for them and their fans! What a man like Jarred Bowen who is a club legend for them! You have won a European trophy before Manchester City!
Comment: Does this mean three teams from PL will play europa next season ?
Comment: BOWEN’S ON FIRE….   And he’s shagging Dani Dyer!
Comment: Brilliant stuff

This is why the conference league is great. There’s a 99% chance that if you don’t like it, it’s because you’re an entitled big 6 fan. Means so much for mid table clubs and is actually achievable with hard work
Comment: West ham are massive everywhere they go 🎶🎶🎶
Comment: Congratulations Hammers! Glad you stuck by the Moyesiah! Enjoy Europa!
Comment: Bigger club than Tottenham
Comment: I'm a ManU fan but absolutely thrilled for David Moyes and West Ham. Always felt Moyes was treated harshly at Utd and after but he has done a great job given time at West Ham. As for the club itself they have a rich history, and I'm glad they now have some recent success. They have provided the Premier league with some of its best and/or iconic players over the years (lampard, ferdinand, Carrick, Di canio, defoe to name a few) and I'm thrilled to see they've got a trophy in the cabinet. Great job hammers!
Comment: What a game, what a finish, congrats to West Ham
Comment: Congratulations West Ham!
Comment: Well done West Ham and well done David Moyes... enjoy the night!
Comment: Good on the players and Moyes. Even with his Everton history I can be a neutral and congratulate him for leading this team to a European trophy. 

Just a shame that there were some hooligans in that crowd tarnishing this great day for the club. 

Also, thank goodness Bowen scored late on. Even at 5am with a low volume, Robbie Savage’s “commentary” is absolute dog turd
Comment: That dance Moyes did was everything
Comment: Great to see West Ham win it, and for Moyes too. Congrats!

Comment: Cat burglars?
Comment: I’m sure he’ll land on his feet.
Comment: RSPCA getting revenge
Comment: Maybe he should get a guard dog. 

Nothing too big that would fight back.
Comment: Cat joke
Comment: Maybe now he knows how that poor cat felt
Comment: Did they escape just by a whisker?
Comment: Meow that wasn't very nice of the burglars.
Comment: Cat was terrified
Comment: Don’t f**k with cats
Comment: Hopefully he can claw back his lost property
Comment: Some heroes wear capes, others wear ski masks
Comment: Feline terrified, amirite? Eh? Eh?
Comment: Womp Womp
Comment: Catwoman came for revenge
Comment: I bet when they broke in they thought “this place is massive. Definitely enough room to swing a cat in here.
Comment: The comment section did not disappoint
Comment: Lol pussy
Comment: Karma
Comment: I wonder if anyone in the West Ham locker room made a joke about maybe that’s how his cat felt

Comment: Hear there's an opening at united available soon if he wants it
Comment: Best manager Westham has had in decades. He took Westham out of relegation fiddlers to a proper PL team.
Comment: You know what would be a great send off? Beating luton before you go!
Comment: Send him off in style and beat City on the 19th. Wouldn’t that be nice . . .
Comment: Moyes to Bayern Munich, here we go!
Comment: I think we're all looking forward to seeing west ham get relegated next season
Comment: West Ham fans want ‘more attractive football’ which I think directly translates to ‘a relegation battle’
Comment: Never seen a sub full of so many morons without a clue about the actual situation at the club. 

We are absolute dog shit, and have been for two years. Yes we won the conference league, but we almost got relegated last year with probably the strongest team we’ve had in two decades. We’ve got one of the biggest budgets in the league outside the sky 6, but have been left with a squad of 13 players because of pure mismanagement by the manager who has left a number of players he signed to just stagnate on the bench. 

We’ve conceded 70 goals this season, and been beaten by more than 4 goals 7 times since March ‘23. 

In the last two seasons, David Moyes’ win % is 0.08% better than Avram Grant’s. 

And all of this, while we’ve consistently played the worst style of football you are ever likely to see. 

So politely, fuck right off.
Comment: Should have gone end of last season ngl

Yes, they won a conference league but they also finished 14th. Only had one more point than 19/20 (when they finished 16th)

Also, God bless the strikers of whatever team he manages next. He'd make Haaland score 5 goals a season somehow.
Comment: You would of thought the club could of shown some class and not signed a new manager until the season finished poor
Comment: Moyes back to United Fam!!!
Comment: He didn’t want it. Therefore good luck to him. Who would when you are being treated like shit? In forty years they will remember him as the best manager of the last 50 years. Dicks
Comment: he's been good for hammers, he's won them a trophy and is in a good place to finish 7th or so. I dont know how different julen lopetegui will be? 

- He resigned from Spain before a major tournament 

- Resigned from Wolves  because of funding issues 

- Resigned from Madrid 

  
He is a serial resigner.
Comment: Moyes returns to MU in dramatic fashion to replace ETH!!!!
Comment: European Champion David Moyes, you mean
Comment: Would Newcastle, Villa, Brighton, Brentford or Man U fans accept Moyes as manager? 

And why not?

There's your answer
Comment: Come back to Deepdale David, we will treat you right 😎
Comment: Pretty disrespectful to announce the new coach before the end of the season given the success Moyes brought.
Comment: I’m a westham fan but westham fans have got too big for their boots as they think because we won a 2nd tier European trophy, we are amazing. We are not that good. Being in the position we are in is as good as we can be as we are no better than any of the teams in front.
Comment: If I am correct, BBC reported that the new boss had already signed in before the club officially announced Moyes's departure. He earned the right to make the announcement himself before the club announcement or even before the new boss signed on. IMO.

Comment: Say what you like about him but for 30m he is a massive upgrade on Ogbonna and the like if he gets his head straight in a new setting
Comment: I'd like to see Harry attempt his infamous wrestling of Luke Shaw to the ground done with Kurt Zouma instead.
Comment: Seems like a win for everyone really
Comment: Wonder what happened for it to be accepted after it was originally rejected. Better add ons/more up front? 

I think he'll do well for West Ham to be honest - there's still a good player in there but depends how much his confidence is shot.
Comment: Played in the right system, Maguire for £30m is a steal.

Played in the wrong system, Maguire for £30m is pretty poor business.

Good deal all round I think.
Comment: Pretty cheap for someone of his experience and I think he’ll flourish in a different setting
Comment: I do like the narrative that he just has to get his head straight, and I'm not saying it's wrong, but I do have some doubts about whether he really going to be anything other than a calamity.
Comment: Maguire, De Gea, Bailly, Telles, Jones, McFred, Donny, Ronaldo all gone or on the way out.

What a beautiful couple of windows for the exits it has been for us.
Comment: Maguires actually really good, he just doesn't suit a high line and the fans crucified him.
Comment: For me, £20m would have been a steal, £30m seems the top end of 'about right' considering we should get 3-4 years out of him at least.

I think Moyse will get the good out of him.

Overall, could have been a lot worse.
Comment: Very good deal for both parties involved. £30m is a reasonable fee for West Ham to pay for a player who is better than all of their CB options right now. £30m is a decent fee for Man United to recoup after spending so much on him initially. 

Career restart for Maguire. Excellent deal.
Comment: United fans be like : Finally no more own goals
Comment: From what i learned this transferwindow, this must mean Moyes is partially owned by the glazers.
Comment: Haha prudent financial management from Man Utd. Buy at £80m, sell for £30m.

Decent deal for Moyes if they can get his confidence back. Should be a boost to their survival chances.
Comment: Wow! For awhile I just didn't see it happening anymore. Guess all the back and forth worked.
Comment: Not bad for someone with goals in his locker.
Comment: Well I’m glad he’s going to West Ham instead of us. I do think he would have done well at either but I think he’s too prone to mistakes.
Comment: He will do well there, the hysteria about him being some kind of clown defender has been way over the top
Comment: Everyone’s happy here. United fans don’t have to have Maguire causing blunders anymore, West Ham fans get an experience defender. And fans of every other team see Maguire stay in the league meaning some easy goals just against wham instead of Man
Comment: well suppose to be happy for man utd or west ham

hmmmm

Comment: He is known as The Spanish Moyes in his home country so Hammers fans are not going to get any exciting football
Comment: I’d be amazed if he’s still their coach next season.

I’ve never understood how he keeps landing these kinds of jobs.
Comment: That makes 4 Basque managers in the Premier League. Somebody needs to hire Deschamps after the Euro's to give us 25% Basques.
Comment: Great Manager! The only thing is, that they got rid of Moyes because his style of play isn't the best to watch, but neither is Lopetegui's!
Comment: One day in the job and he’s already ruined Paqueta’s career. Knew this guy was a menace…

Watch West Ham sell Bowen to United and Lopetegui walk out the day before the EPL starts!
Comment: He won’t last a season, he’ll walk before Easter. He always walks, hugely unreliable
Comment: I think Moyes couldn’t have taken the club any further but the appointment seems naive. Feels like they looked where he had managed before rather than how it went down. Could be one of the earliest sacking of the season
Comment: He'll bomb
Comment: Surely he had to have known about Paqueta situation but if not, welcome to the west ham way.
Comment: #NOPETEGUI

Comment: Old news, pretty much confirmed like a month ago
Comment: it's time to stop this woke nonsense

Comment: Perhaps without Europa League or an early exit…but the Thursday-Sunday fixtures will pile up.
Comment: hell of a game by west ham so far!
Comment: Manu could do with a manager like Moyes, oh wait.
Comment: Behave
Comment: I’d say the Europe race for sure. Title will be tough. But you have to like competition at the top.
Comment: Real question is would Rice stay if they finished top 3?
Comment: Not title race, I’m afraid
Comment: Don't think so but stranger things have happened
Comment: My club is basically out of contention without a major change so hey I’d rather see a surprise team like West Ham win the league than a usual super power like Chelsea. Let’s go West Ham
Comment: Well no
Comment: I admit I said the same about Leicester, but.......... No!
Comment: Pretty crazy what a game they pulled off, Moyes is doing a really good job at that club right now, maybe they can steal a CL spot.
Comment: COYI⚒
Comment: GSE GSE
Comment: So if Arsenal win liverpool. Are they in title race?
Comment: Moves in his element working wonders again. I miss that formerly ginger fuck.
Comment: You could easily see West Ham knicking a champs league spot for next season, especially if Leicester, Spurs and Man U keep dropping the ball.   
I'd be aiming for some silverware, Europe or Fa cup.. bringing something home is what  would change everything.  It would make them real contenders next season.
Comment: Next time Pawson refs for us can he tell us to wear some lipstick? That way we can look nice when he fucks us
Comment: As good as west ham have played so far I think it’s too early to say they’re in the title race. I do hope they make too 4 over Man U though.
Comment: we are winning the league its so obvious

Comment: Sounds like they're at risk of making BANK.

If only they could sell a player every summer for £80m+, they'd be laughing.
Comment: At risk ? The man is gone 100%
Comment: a team with ongoing 115 charges making another 85m+ transfer before getting punished, just another day in pl
Comment: Did gundogun leave before or after finding out about the 115 charges?
Comment: I think West Ham would take 85 quite gladly.
Comment: Kovacic + Nunes + Paqueta is not how you replace Gundogan and Bernardo. City deserve the benefit of the doubt more than any club but I don’t understand the planning here. It could lead to a very static & clogged midfield. 🤔
Comment: 85m?
Comment: I’ve loved having him and hope he stays, but this is one where I do think he’s replaceable. We won’t find the same player, but definitely can use that money to bolster the squad - hopefully by finally signing an actual striker so Antonio doesn’t have to do what he does until he’s 45.
Comment: Genuinely love Paqueta, he’s always so damn good whenever I watch him.
Comment: I’d take 85m all day long 😂
Comment: at risk??? 85 million is a pretty generous coup
Comment: Man, West Ham with this guy just look like a better team in possession. His hold up & link up is so crucial to your buildups. It’s gonna be a massive loss.
Comment: 85mil? Ffs
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: That’s a fuckton of money even in this market
Comment: Is he worth that? I like Paqueta enough but 85M?
Comment: If you can beat ‘em tour continues.
Comment: Hello there Lucas
Comment: If Bernardo is leaving us…. Yeah
Comment: City will probably sign him. Plus,  the Citizens have just signed a sponsorship deal with ACME, so I'm pretty sure they'll abide by FFP rules.  

Comment: Ref fucked up, there was no foul, Gakpo was about to score and Taylor blew. He then realised he fucked up and called the physio on, Areola has no clue what is going on, Taylor tells him to go to ground. Another week another shambles
Comment: They need to request the audio from Taylors mic. He never blew his whistle for a free kick, the ball was in play.

Areola confusingly thinks he's been given a free kick. Hence his reaction to Gakpos run.

It looks like Taylor panicked and knowing he made the wrong call, he ran over to Areola and motioned for him to go down to the ground to fake an injury. Taylor himself called over physios to sell it. In the heat of the moment he might have just been caught saying something very stupid to Areola
Comment: The official story is, Taylor saw a foul on the keeper but “played advantage” so when Gakpo went for the ball he blew to bring it back for the foul and gave an uncontested drop ball. It’s how they’ll frame it, BUT: 

A) When is advantage ever given to a keeper in his own box when there’s no attack in progress? You would just blow the foul. 

B) He didn’t play the ball quickly to make use of the advantage.

C) The whole spontaneous “injury” and physios being called by Taylor (to the injured player & medical team’s suprise) was very very strange. 

He fucked up and covered his own back basically. 
At this point I don’t have the energy to care. It is what it is and this season has been an absolute shit show from start to finish decision wise.
Comment: I saw it live. No whistle was blown and a foul wasn't given.

Whole thing makes no sense.
Comment: Taylor fucked up, plain and simple. Calling for the physio while telling Areola to go to the floor just made it obvious.

But nothing will be done or said because...... Why the fuck would they do anything about it?
Comment: Such a brainless moment by Areola. He should have gone down if he needed medical assistance (which to be fair, he probably did given he went down a few times and threw the ball instead of kicking).

Having said that, how stupid do you have to be to throw the ball like you’re about to take a goal kick then bend down and take your eyes off it for ages. Is this is first game of professional football? Does he think he’s playing in the park with his mates? I was screaming at the TV for him to put his head up thinking someone is going to come and tap it in. 

I’m an Arsenal fan. Both this and the Gabriel incident should have been goals given the stupidity of the players involved. I don’t like to see goals given like that but rules are rules.
Comment: Just one weekend of normal refereeing please
Comment: Guys PGMOL are just silly and make mistakes and these mistakes always benefit City in the long run if you notice this you’re crazy tho
Comment: Taylor lost the plot there. One of the worst ref incidents I’ve seen as it wasn’t about getting a call wrong just totally inexplicable.
Comment: It's one of those errors where I really want the audio to come out for it, let's see if Taylor did blow for a free kick after all or if he's just had a monumental fuck up, I'd like to know what he was saying to the keeper after as well. Keeper even looked confused by it
Comment: Sorry but he needs to be sent to Universal Credit for how many fuck ups he's done.
Comment: Taylor has been incompetent for ages not just this decision but previous matches too, he clearly isn’t in the right frame of mind to referee a match. This is where the confidence in PGMOL drops all the time because, they will protect their own in the wrong way. If a ref is making consistent errors he needs to be stepped down for his own good as well as everyone else’s.
Comment: Did anyone really think Antony Taylor was going to let a silly little mistake like that stop him from refereeing Saudi Sunday league games for £150k a week
Comment: People talking about "spirit of the game" are being ridiculous. Players make mistakes, that IS part of the game. We can hardly go around stopping play whenever it happens. 

The job of the ref is to implement the rules not to change the game depending on how they feel it should go.
Comment: After the ref calls over the physios, you can literally [see Areola put a hand on the ref as if to say it isn't needed. When the camera goes back to see the ref in the front view, you can even lip read "the floor"](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/kUnZZ165Mb) as if he's telling him to get on the floor to cover his fuck up.

How do refs continue to get even worse? You'd think we'd have reached rock bottom a couple of seasons ago.
Comment: Isn't it clear that the PGMOL are corrupt?  Some PL fans act like it could never happen in England, but c'mon.  The NBA, La Liga  Ligue 1, cricket, they've all had this happen, with way fewer public instances than what we've seen the last 2 years in the PL.  I chalk it up to our British deference to authority and a built-in complex about british institutions not posssssssibly being compromised...
Comment: Should’ve kicked it in like Nani did. Then they have a decision to make.
Comment: Clearly this is another instance of not wanting to punish a player because of a “children’s mistake”
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: Think the ref had a brain fart and thought he blew the whistle too, Gakpo was the only one sharp to the moment, then ref had to cover his tracks, he woulda got away with it too if it weren’t for you meddling kids

Comment: Fuck it, bring him in and make it 116
Comment: If he's guilty he can kiss his career goodbye. To give you an idea of the length of the ban Paqueta might face, the footballer linked below was banned for 10 years for a single case of spot-fixing. Paqueta has been charged with four cases of spot-fixing.

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63302914](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63302914)

edit: another player, Bradley Wood of Lincoln City, was also banned for five years for intentionally getting booked twice. 

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43829525](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43829525)
Comment: No wonder Man City want him, he'll fit right in
Comment: I can never understand the logic of players who do this.

You're earning astronomical wages, why risk ruining your career by trying to squeeze out a little more on the side?
Comment: If I'm wrong anyways let me know. But from memory this all sprung from West Ham v Villa on March 12th of last season. That game Paqueta committed 4 fouls, above his average of ~ 1 a game, not completely unusual to happen though. 

The problem was that multiple accounts were created the day before all with some relation to Paqueta, and all of whom bet the maximum amount on him to receive a yellow. 

Super fucking fishy also add to the fact he was odds on 8/11 to receive a yellow (had 3 to this point), and all new accounts were created on Betway, sponsors of West Ham. 

Doesn't look good.
Comment: This would’ve never happened had he just been a Manchester city player.
Comment: Imagine doing your damn best playing the game and your teammate is in his own little side quest for a card. Utterly abhorrent
Comment: If found guilty he can be banned for many years. At 26 yo this could be a career ending punishment. My question is simple. Why in the world do a multi millionaire player need to do that? Baffling.
Comment: Gave the ball away for 115 FC’s first goal on Sunday
Comment: they have time to pick on everyone except Man City...
Comment: Go to city. They’ll lawyer up and you won’t have to face the charges till you have retired anyway !
Comment: sponsored by betway
Comment: Welcome to Manchester City, Paquetá!
Comment: Besides the spot fixing crime itself could Paqueta also be punished for essentially endangering other players on purpose? Assuming he is found guilty of the betting of course. I know at least two of those yellows he got were for late lunges. I know players get yellows for those type of tackles all the time but those players were doing it for the game, not for bet fixing.
Comment: dude thats spot fixing. Pakistani crickets were jailed for it, and some got life bans.

Comment: Head on over to ESPN bets now to bet on the length of the punishment!
Comment: Should have just kept going and done it 115 times.
Comment: Why don’t we just stop betting?
Comment: Fucking joke man. As if they don’t make enough money. I’ll say it again 97% of professional footballers are not worth looking up to
Comment: Ban yellow card betting instead.

Comment: I for one am happy WHU didn't get impatient and sack moyes after a poor run last season
Comment: Well done, congrats, and thank you West Ham.
Comment: My balls are empty
Comment: We’re HUGE
Comment: Thank you David, very cool!
Comment: Moyes ball
Comment: My ugly crying face went to a crying face with a smile. North London in the mud
Comment: West Ham has been getting better every year
Comment: One of those weird results that will happen over the course of a season. Issue is they very very very rarely happen to Guardiola teams, so any loss of this type feels devastating if you're going for the title. As an LFC fan who doesn't always watch Arsenal, main thing I took away from that game was how incredibly good Odegaard is. What a skillful and tidy little player. Kudos looks fantastic too. Both players look after the ball so well
Comment: I thought arsenal fans were pretty pathetic for leaving the stadium with 10min to go. How can the team win anything when the fans don’t believe in them? I guess in my mind would make sense if arsenal were 10th on the table, but they are in a title race. Thoughts?
Comment: Jesus is not that guy for Arsenal. They need a full on striker asap
Comment: What’s worse? The curse of being top at Christmas or the curse of being top at New Year?
Comment: MASSIVE
Comment: The one time I put money on Arsenal to win or draw. . . They go and f*ck up at home. 

You had one Job!
Comment: That's so Spursy of them.
Comment: Bit of a tricky fixture Vs West Ham
Comment: North London is brown tonight
Comment: Arsenals attack genuinely looks as bad as ours this year, now defensively they are WAY clear of us hence the ginormous gap
Comment: Good performance from West ham tonight. Brilliant end to the year for them and they outplayed us, resolute defensively and took their chances. As for us, we were abysmal offensively, apart from odegaard who looked near to his best today, wonderful feet and passing. But the rest were nowhere near good enough, intensity was lacking, which for me zinny epitomised with some very lax passing.Maybe they've been instructed to do this, but there were several times a ball was played into/across six yards or could have been played, but no one was attacking it. The same thing happened against Liverpool. We easily could have scored had Jesus or martinelli been attacking that area. 

I thought Ben White did fairly well today as well, a few dangerous crosses. We deserved to lose. And the first goal was a goal, not clear and obvious enough although it did look out. The only positive I can take is that I saw the spark in odegaard again today, and in what was a dreadfully boring game from my perspective, he provided some entertainment. Also the fans leaving early was pretty poor. Given our late success this season and last, that was disappointing.
We need a proper striker. As much as I like jesus, he's only really a second striker. He seems to lack that strikers instinct from what I've seen.
Comment: Kudus…what a signing.

Comment: I've been Moyes in for a long time. I've seen us be shit my entire life and under him we've reached Europe and won a trophy but now I've seriously got my doubts. Our style of play is about sitting back and then relying on individual creativity to get goals on the counter but without Paqueta there has been no creativity and we've been found out defensively conceding 11 in the last 3 games. There is no attacking plan or threat going forward. Sure when Paqueta returns we will probably start picking up results but is the manager really doing a good job if we are completely reliant on individual brilliance for chances?  Is the boring style of play really worth it when we are conceding easily? I don't think Moyes has a plan b at all so if we've been found out I don't think he can fix it.
Comment: I am sick to death of rival fans poking their nose in like experts and offering utter shite opinions. We are the ones paying and travelling to watch this team every week.
Comment: I’m a season ticket holder with West Ham and have been for about 7 years. This is what some of the other season ticket holders around me and I see the current situation. 

Moyes has been poor for a long while, the second half of the 21/22 season we saw a big downturn in premier league form, that was masked by a good europa league run, last season we were awful and faced relegation for much of the season, that was masked by the conference league win. 

The start of this season we had some good wins against Brighton, Chelsea, Man U and Arsenal but a lot of our other wins were very close and we were quite lucky to get all 3 points (eg. Burnley/NottForest) we also lost at home to Everton when they weren’t in the best of form. 


So when we hit this recent run of awful form like we are in now it doesn’t feel like a blip or a bad run, it feels like a return to the norm. When all of this is coupled with the fact that we play some of the least exciting football in the league and have a team picked full of players who are playing are out of position and out of form when we have other players on the bench that haven’t even been given a chance, it is very frustrating week in week out to go and watch it. 

I don’t think it’s ungrateful as many have labeled it, fans are entitled to express when they aren’t happy with what they are paying for. Not to mention Moyes has always had disdain for the fanbase with frequent insults and grumpy comments to interviewers.


Arsenal fans were crying for Wenger out near the end of his time there. He did more for arsenal than Moyes has for West Ham. But I wouldn’t ever say that arsenal fans weren’t entitled to want him gone if he wasn’t performing for them anymore. 

All that being said people do need to have some respect and acceptance for what Moyes has done and some of the comments about him have been unfair. But all in all I want a change!
Comment: arsenal wanted wenger out
Comment: If you actually watched our games you would understand. We are absolutely terrible to watch I go to pretty much every home and away game the worst part of the day is the actual game. I can take that when we're picking up results but when you're not it is very difficult to watch. We haven't won in 2024, we haven't even scored a goal in open play either.
Comment: That trophy also covered up a horrendous season. Moyes-ball is outdated and needs to be replaced. The team is too good to hold them back like that. Moyes has been great for us but things run their course
Comment: Just watch 90 minutes of a West Ham game and you'll understand. It's fine watching match of the day and checking the table then wondering why are West Ham fans so entitled. 

The football is absolutely dogshit to watch. Especially if you're paying for a season ticket which is not cheap these days and you have to sit through that, it's understandable why fans are complaining especially when it's a bad run of form. 

You're just paying to watch the other team play. And it's not like West Ham don't have the talent either where they have to sit back and scrap it out then nick a goal on the break
Comment: We've picked up 109 points from our last 90 matches in the league. Before then we had picked up 88 points from 49 matches.  




Yes we won the conference league, which was a very good achievement, though I feel the Europa league semi final was a greater achievement, the only match we weren't overwhelming favourites for in the conference league was the final.





We lost 2-0 yesterday didn't have a single shot. Areola made 4-5 really good to excellent saves.  




We have been getting worse since we beat Liverpool at home on the 19/11/2021.
Comment: Bunch of plastic fans of big clubs chiming in absolute bullshit here I see
Comment: I think the fans are sick of counter attacking football when they have really talented players. And now since the results have dipped, they're even more unhappy. They are very boring to watch tbh. There's nothing wrong with playing on the counter against the top 6.But fans probably expect better against the teams around them and lower teams. I personally still feel sacking him right now is ridiculous and disrespectful but maybe look for a new manager for the next season onwards.
Comment: They're afraid he's gonna make them fall out of the "big 17"
Comment: Newcastle fan here. I've watched every West Ham game this year with my girlfriend's family (All West Ham fans). They have been so tedious to watch. Games against Brighton, Bournemouth and Sheffield were so boring to watch and they were hapless against Man U, Arsenal and Forest. They were dam lucky to get the points against Brighton and Bournemouth as well. Both teams had a ridiculous amount of wasted opportunities against West Ham. 

Reminds me so much of when Sam Allardyce was in charge of Newcastle. Just sitting there, waiting for the first goal to be conceded
Comment: WH fan:

We’ve been poor for a few years now, we have no attacking output/plan/idea

Antonio has openly said on a podcast that we spend 90% of the week working on how to stop the opposition scoring and then 10% at the end working on how to score 

Our entire attacking plan is either hope JWP is on the money with his set-pieces or that one of Bowen/Kudus/the currently injured paqueta creates something from nothing.

We have no idea how to play with possession of the ball and are usually at our most vulnerable at this point.

We are supposed to be a defensive counter attacking team, except teams can literally walk through the middle of our team and create chances at will.

We are a defensive team with no idea how to defend, we’ve lost the last 3 games with an agg score of 0-11.
We’ve played 8 games this calendar year, yet to win a game, having played championship team Bristol city twice.
We’ve only scored 2 goals from open play this year and one of those was against Bristol city.

We don’t know how to attack, and no longer know how to defend.
It’s absolutely awful football
People from the outside looking in who say we’re 8th and in Europe, are most likely the same people who a month ago said your 6th and in Europe, but in a months time when we’re 10th and out of Europe what will your response be then.

Most West Ham fans have seen this time and time before. We don’t expected CL football, we know how rare our trophy wins are, but to be told to sit down & shut up every week because look how Moyes has done & what do you expect ect…..
We don’t expect to beat Man Utd & arsenal every week but equally I don’t expect to have to sit and endure the most boring defensive football on the planet and still get spanked every week, we would rather attack and have a go if we’re going to get beat every week, plenty of teams do Brighton, Brentford, Villa etc

As for Moyes….we have the 7th highest wage bill, he’s had the 8th highest spend since he took over, having spent 500m but we somehow still have a partial retirement home with 34 year old Cresswell, 38 fabianski, 35 ogbonna and somehow despite Moyes having been here for 4 years we’re still in the boat of having to pull (soon to be) 34 year old injury crocked Right winger Antonio to play upfront because Moyes doesn’t know what an actual striker is 

Moyes has had an iron fist over the transfers at West Ham and while some have worked out really well, we as fans can’t look past the players he continually refused to sign as he said they’re not good enough for the prem, some prime examples being James Maddison when he was at Norwich, Harry maguire when he was at hull, Gyokeres who was Coventry but now the top scorer in Europe at sporting Lisbon and Ivan Toney before he went to Brentford…..but also made arguably our worst signing ever in Jordan hugill from Preston for 10m. He played 3 games for a total of 22m
Comment: Arsenal fans lecturing people on managers haha - hypocrites must have forgotten what they did / how they treated Wenger.
Comment: >As an Arsenal fan, this is crazy to me!

Too young to remember Wenger Out?
Comment: I think, WH fans think the team is better than it actually is. In that sense i think winning the cup is working against Moyes, since it has warped expectations.

The team was overperforming last year internationally, now fans seem to think they are a top 5 team.

Imo Moyes has done a very good job with the team and its absolutely bizarre to me how many seemingly want him gone.
Comment: Because he doesn’t play the totally fictional, pie in the sky ‘west ham way’ that’s never existed in the first place
Comment: This is stupid. Winning a trophy was great for them last season but his style clearly isn't good for building for the future. 

You don't give a manager more time because of what he did, you give a manager time for what you think he's gonna do......
Comment: They’re underperforming with them, and the fact he now has a talent like Kudus and is still playing safe boring football says everything, that squad is above his level now imo
Comment: This post can be paraphrased as “as an arsenal fan, those poor people over at West Ham should be happy with their lot. Don’t they know the top 6 is only for us elites”

Comment: Well, apparently you don't have to invest to fix things, just remove any deadwood you have early in the summer and adapt. So, yes, credit where it's due, Moyes is truly the new special one.
Comment: [removed]
Comment: Turns out our draw against them was a good draw
Comment: I don’t know how we did that

I think everyone’s expectations were subverted today.
Comment: West Ham is impressing me, especially Antonio, dude’s a beast
Comment: 
*Maybe now that they have absolutely pantsed the fucking hipster heroes of Brighton and their Fun Lovin Criminal*

Did a Seagull fucking rape you, I'm dying 😂
Comment: They stayed in PL, won CL and they got to EUL semifinals two years ago. It's not the most avant garde football, but it definitely is working. I would like a little more depth thought, pressing in the midfield sometimes could work even better.
Comment: I’m a Chelsea fan, and I must say I enjoyed watching Brighton lose today more than seeing united and arsenal suffer for points.
Comment: Feels good to see Brighton and their manager brought down a peg or two.
Comment: I say this as a United fan and we have a checkered relationship with Moyes but let's give the guy credit. Always seems a couple.of games away from being a candidate for sacking. But has turned them from relegation scrap regulars to European regulars and won't heir first trophy last year. Because of the summer transfer internal battles people were saying he should go again and yet they lose their best player and they are still currently top (admittedly having played a game more than some and early days). But give Moyes some.credit. The stage that is Man United was too big for him but at this level he is a very good manager
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: That was MASSIVE
Comment: Media is never going to give him the credit he deserves because he’s not English and ‘failed’ at their precious Man U.
Comment: The Bowen goal was nice
Comment: 18% possession, 3-1 win. Had a game plan, played it to perfection. If they keep setting up to beat the team in front of them as well as they did today they are in for a really good season
Comment: I like Zouma in the back, that dude kicks anything that comes near him.
Comment: Thought Moyes pulled off a bit of an old school masterclass tbh

Great to watch those goals. Some classy finishes 

The Brighton manager will be feeling that one for a while I reckon
Comment: I was going to agree I think West Ham look really solid but then I got to the second paragraph 😂 why you have to insult us alongside praising West Ham
Comment: Rope-a-dope worked for Ali, guess it can work for West Ham!  Just afraid for them once teams can neutralisé their counters and break their shape.  Antonio has always been a favourite of mine!  Reason why I don’t hate West Ham.  Though Paqueta is doing a good job for me to start disliking them though.
Comment: West ham looks so solid man, not gonna lie I cheered for them because I put some massive bets on them to get this away win, but hell they looked so good entire game, I had a feeling that David Moyes prepared them so well and whole squad in general was great. Areola with some great saves and really solid in the middle and efficient up front. I might even watch some Green Street Hooligans today to celebrate this massive win. But overall really good game. Premier League is the best league in the world, hats off.

Comment: post the 2 goals from west ham too also post the PL table and show me where spurs are

Comment: Spuurrsssyyyyu! =D
Comment: Tottenham is just sad

Comment: Downright embarrassing, disgusting behavior
Comment: That small group of idiots have literally just made every neutral in England who actually wanted you to win because we want to see all our teams do well in Europe, turned us all against you after cheering you on for the first 30 mins
Comment: They should find out who they were and ban them for life. No excuse for that behavior.
Comment: Not only the reputation of english fans in Europe suffers because of this, but the reputation of football in the Czech Republic takes a hit too.

This is a big occasion for the Czechs, even people who dgaf about football pay attention to this match. Now everyone will just confirm their stereotypes that football is for idiots.

I wouldn't be surprised if the Czech Republic won't be interested in organising anything like this any time soon. I know no one cares about that and the stadium is probably too small for a match like this, but I do care about the image of football in the country and unfortunately this will probably make it worse, where this should have been the event that makes it better...

Thanks to a couple of dickheads thrashing the city and throwing shit on players during the match. Cheers.
Comment: Beer, Englishmen and football are a deadly combo
Comment: Seriously, what is going on with this match? How can people think this is okay?
Comment: [removed]
Comment: We were in Prague today by total chance and let me tell you. The West Ham hooligans were all out on full force by 11am. The square was covered in piles of beer and some had thrown flares into the square. I have pics but idk how to post them or I would.
Comment: Yes, it was awful.

But let’s not forget the Fiorentina fans attacking West Ham fans in the streets prior to the match. It’s in every fan group.
Comment: The actions of a few don't represent the majority 🏆
Comment: Had you told me that of all the London sides, West Ham would be the next to win any European final, I'd have laughed you out of the room. That being said, had you told me of all the London sides' supporters, West Ham's would be the next to injure players during a European final, I'd respond simply with "So what's your point?"  A real shame.
Comment: >just as our reputation in Europe was starting to get better

Don't think it was mate
Comment: This is just my personal experience and I’m not trying to tar everyone with the same brush.

About a decade ago I was living in the UK in London. I was a Liverpool fan and made loads of trips to Anfield but also tried to see as many different grounds as possible. 

Anyways checked out Arsenal, Fulham, palace, white hart lane , always dressed in neutral colors , no issues , great experiences. One of my workmates was a hammer and he got me tix to a game with his mates. Fuck me what a shit experience it was - straight away in the stadium I got dirty looks and a few negative comments but ignored it. Same when we for beers at halftime. After the game went to a west ham pub near the ground, there having a beer with my mates not bothering anyone - got called a paki, told to fuck off etc. I just left after a while , I didn’t know want the hassle for me out my workmate and his mates. 
Went to footy games in Spain, Italy never experienced anything like it, lived in London for a decade and never really experienced racism. Hopefully things have changed but doubt it.
Comment: This thread is full of embarrassingly reactionary takes. Seen the West Ham fans that congregated in the square referred to as ‘Hooligans’ because they left their little behind.
Comment: Hopefully the Man City fans show we ain’t all scum.
Comment: Who’s reputation? English fans are bellends everywhere they go
Comment: I hope they get kicked out for that because it’s not acceptable. You can’t just throw sh*t at people just because you don’t like them/their team. And you can’t cut them on the head either. Absolutely stupid. I guarantee this will affect the City fans later this week.
Comment: Okay, what did I miss?
Comment: They proved why the English authorities don't let people drink while watching English football games
Comment: fn stupid... all that good will from Alkmaar pissed away

Comment: Hilarious how Varane got widely lambasted for pointing out players are being asked to play too many games. People kept bringing up his salary. You can pay them 10 mil a week, there is a limit to how much the human body can do. If this keeps up it's just going to end up reducing the quality of the product, its counterproductive.
Comment: I’ll say it again - I’ve never known so many ACL’s in one season.
Comment: He was there during the dark days and now during this turnaround, big Lascalles has been a tireless club servant I wish him well and a speedy recover. 
Comment: Nah you guys don't get it. We need more games so that we have football to watch every 2 days.
Comment: How are Newcastle getting all these crazy injuries during the season. Medical team , training , recovery ?
Comment: Feels like it's the 400th ACL injury we've seen this season across the league. An unusually high number anyway.
Comment: Man ACL injurys are fucking brutal.
Comment: So this is how Wolves are going to get ECL...
Comment: I'm genuinely curious the last time we had a fully fit squad to pick from, I'm going to say it was at least 18 months ago and it won't happen again for another year.
Comment: Newcastle medical team has got to go. It's incredible how they can have this many injuries, surely they are fucking something up.
Comment: Brutal
Comment: Villa have 4 with massive ACL injuries too. This season is nuts.
Comment: Fair play that he managed to get back on the pitch. When I did my ACL recently I couldn’t even stand up and had to be carried off the pitch.
Comment: Oof, that's rough for newcastle... definitely no europe for them
Comment: Newcastle are having a disaster, as soon as the strikers come back the whole defense is out with an injury. 

Can't think of a single starting player on the squad that hasn't had a long-term injury at this rate, other than maybe Schar?
Comment: I'm amazed they're holding 8th with the amount of injuries and the way they've been leaking goals.
Comment: That’s his Newcastle career done
Comment: Don’t think you can say it’s bad luck at this point.

Comment: Newcastle's injury record this season is nearly as bad as Chelsea's!

Comment: I remember when Covid hit and thinking West Ham were to benefit the most because it was so toxic in the months leading up to it. Moyes managed to turn things around in the empty stadium months but he wouldn't have been able to do it with the crowd there. 

West Ham in my lifetime of 30 odd years have always been a lower mid table club, with an occasional relegation battle or relegation. Moyes has gotten them European football. Won their first proper trophy for around 40 years and now they're complaining because they're bored. They've been going well in Europe and they're 6th in the League. What exactly are they looking for? 

West Ham supporters are one of the most detrimental supports in football. They can be great at times but things get very toxic, very quickly.
Comment: Moyes' tenure as a manager is a real experiment to test if average football fans can really back up the "don't care if we play shit as long as we win points and trophies" claims
Comment: I was saying boo-urns
Comment: Match going West Ham fans watch the club regularly  I trust their judgment, last thing they want is someone like me who knows nothing telling them how they should feel.
Comment: West Ham fans booing Moyes is the same energy as booing Rice: booing the two people who have done the most for your club in the last 10 years
Comment: I'm a huge fan of moyesball. We are getting results. Grinding out points and punching above our weight. Hell,  the choice between this and fighting to avoid relegation? I'll take moyesball everytime.
Comment: Watched the game as a neutral. Thought West Ham were absolutely woeful. In the final minutes of added time Johnson was casually strolling over to take a throw in. Kudus passed backwards with one of the final actions of the game when he had a chance to put it in the box. 

They have a right to be frustrated. No urgency to go and win the game and performance was extremely flat. Bournemouth were the better team and Areola was crucial for West Ham.
Comment: Yeah it’s a strange one from the outside looking in maybe they should be getting better results with that squad, but moyes has them 6th and going well in the Europa and won a trophy last year which seems to be getting laughed at which is beyond me regardless of the competition
Comment: I watched the game on TV last night, and I felt like booing.
Comment: Because fans travel for miles each way in the freezing cold, paying up to £100 a ticket and £8 for a pint, to watch some of the worst football you have seen in your life in an Athletics Stadium.

I don’t like this narrative from pundits and other fans that little old West Ham should be thankful because they look at the table once in a while and see we won a trophy last year. From 2002 to May 2023 we were shit despite spending almost 200 mil. The cup win papered over that. 

Be defensive against Arsenal, Man U, and Spurs. Sure. But to shithouse wins against Burnley, Forest, Toopola, etc…it’s just shit. Sure, I like winning, but I can’t remember the last time I actually enjoyed watching us play. We just sit back and hope for a moment of magic from Paqueta or Kudus and rely on a MoTM performance from Areola. At home to Bournemouth we play four CDMs. Add that to the shambolic transfer window.

If I’m being honest, I think the booing made us look stupid, but I 100% understand the frustration.
Comment: Weird fans. It's not a one off, been happening for years with West ham. I think they think they should be better than arsenal and spurs for some reason. They all pretty much hate moves even though he's won a European trophy for the club and built a very decent team that are around 6th in the league thus year.
Comment: West Ham fans are impossible to please. 

In their heads they are as big as Arsenal.
Comment: The fans paid good money to watch that game and it was absolutely dire, seriously, 4 Central Midfielders, set up to defend at home and we couldn't string a sequence of passes together.

So booing the performance on the night is fine, they paid their money and they're entitled to voice their opinion.

We're 6th but we're vastly over performing in relation to our stats, and frankly it's not been looking good for a while now.

We're winless in 5, against lower league and bottom of the table opposition, plus Brighton (who were missing most of their first XI, and managed to keep their first clean sheet of the season) and Bournemouth, we've now got two fixtures against much tougher opposition coming up.

We've also just let 3 players go and not replaced any of them in an already thin squad, when we're sitting in 6th and trying to complete in the EL.

To many fans it'll look like the writings on the wall with regards to the direction we're heading
Comment: Because Moyes Ball is atrocious. There are more important things than points. And West Ham are a top 10-12 club and have spent a lot of money. They got a free new stadium not so long ago. The idea that they're overachieving is ridiculous. Moyes has done an average job, playing terrible football.
Comment: Moyes will always be in our history, but moyesball is such a mixed bag. Our good results are more often than not brought by individual brilliance. 

His man-management is poor, often leaving certain players completely excluded (deservedly or not) from a chance in the first team. He is too risk-averse to rotate, leaving key players totally fatigued at key times. 

His tactical aptitude is limited. We will never ever win a game due to tactical nuance. It will only be on the counter/set pieces, which is fine if it works but isn’t a reliable enough source of goals to base a whole football philosophy around. When moyesball works, it is a slow game with good moments sprinkled in. When it doesn’t, it results in a horrific performance with little to no glimmer of hope from anyone due to the naturally low posession% of the football we play. We have incredible players in paqueta/kudus/bowen and people want to see them play fluid exciting football. Not simply longball/holdup. 

He struggles to find a way of making players work. It is as simple as a player either IS/ISNT a moyes type of player. Look at Ings/Scamacca/Haller/Benrhama/Kral/vlasic/downes. All players with positive track records and careers ahead of them but Moyes WILL NOT make them work. He won’t change up tactically to get the best out of them and subsequently pisses millions up the wall waiting for a paqueta or kudus to stick. 

He is wildly unwilling to work with others. We’ve had a high turnover of coaches during his time, we even brought in someone to help our posession and attacking phases but they left within a year due to moyes never listening to his advice. (During last season in our relegation battle). 

Every west ham fan i know is appreciative of what he has done for the club, and I personally am moyes in and reassess at the end of the season. But that isn’t to say he deserves years ahead of him. I like moyesball, I love the fight we put up on a good day against a bigger team and the satisfaction we get after a hard fought win. 

BUT, west ham are in a position where we are knocking on the doors of larger clubs. We gave up upton park for this big stadium because we aspire to BE a larger club. David moyes will go down in history as one of our greatest managers, but if we really want to progress, to fully utilise the talent we currently have at the club while we have it and to take us to the next level, the question is can he take us any further then he already has. 

THIS is what has the fanbase split. We all know what he has done for us, and we all know clubs have fallen down the table chasing more attractive football. But with the aspirations we have and time ticking down until the likes of paqueta/kudus get snapped up by huge clubs, how much further can he realistically take us.
Comment: Boos for all the money they just wasted on Kalvin Phillips. To be fair, it wasn't as much as city wasted on him!
Comment: They realized that they're West Ham fans
Comment: Same reason we got rid of Gary O'Neil at the beginning of the season - the football being played is fucking dreadful to watch. God forbid West Ham want to get out of their lane and play in Europe with an entertaining brand of football. Why's it so difficult for people to understand?
Comment: I think they were saying boo-urns
Comment: I heard someone describe going to watch West Ham felt like you were actually going to watch the other team play due to the way Moyes sets up his team. It seems like an effective way to play football and their position in the league shows this but I can imagine it must be frustrating as a ST holder going to home matches to watch your team sit back and let the oppositon pass the ball around.

It by no means these are genuine or accurate figures, they are merely the information you have handed to Companies House.  Please don’t take this as gospel.  

Companies House work on an honesty policy, they literally take your word as ‘fact’ and put it into record. That’s it, they don’t do any fact checking or corroborating of data, they put the figures in as fact.  Remember that Football Clubs are nearly always exclusively Limited Companies and are privately owned, so have no Public Shareholders to declare with.

Comment: I’m a Liverpool fan but will congratulate Arsenal on their efforts this season. Not a bottle job in my mind, they’ve been a scary team all season, cracking defence and decent in attack. Top striker for them might get them over the line next time. City are the machine, let’s see if anyone can do them next season.
Comment: Arteta is a world class manager, this season cements that for me.

It's just such a machine he's up against, to win 17 out of you're final 18 and still not come away with the title is mind numbing.

Fair play to City, Credit to Pep and they're players, Arsenal will be  back next year to challenge.
Comment: My fellow Arsenal fans, just shut the fuck up and stop giving cope and foolish takes.

If City win today, congrats to them, it was a good title race. We go again next season.

Comment: Fan favourite often changes between a handful of players, but I can relatively confidently say it’s Craig Dawson. 

It’ll be a sad day when he leaves in January. 

Outside of that, I think Fornals is a favourite among fans due to his work rate and commitment to West Ham. He’s been quoted as saying he’d happily retire with us.

Cresswell and Ogbonna are sort of legend status so they’ll always be favourites even if they play badly. 

And of course, everyone loves Antonio. If you get a jersey, I would probably go for him.
Comment: Diafra Sakho is considerd a club legend you should get his name on the shirt

Comment: Manchester City was not tried in court by UEFA due to a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2020. Initially, UEFA had banned Manchester City from European competitions for two seasons and fined them €30 million for allegedly overstating sponsorship revenues to meet financial fair play (FFP) requirements. However, Manchester City appealed this decision to CAS, which overturned the ban and reduced the fine to €10 million.

The CAS ruling found that many of the alleged breaches were either not established or time-barred, meaning they had occurred too long ago to be actionable under UEFA's regulations. Specifically, UEFA's statute of limitations only allows for enforcement of FFP breaches that occurred within the previous five years. This time limitation played a crucial role in CAS's decision to overturn the ban [oai_citation:1,Man City Premier League charges explained: What are they? What could punishment be?

In contrast, the Premier League's ongoing investigation does not have such a time bar, which means older allegations can still be considered. This distinction between UEFA and Premier League rules is a key reason why the Premier League's case against Manchester City continues, while UEFA's case was dismissed [oai_citation:3,Man City Premier League charges explained: What are they?

Man city have been playing with fire for some time. They’ve cheated in broad daylight. I hope they get punished accordingly, rightfully. If they are not somehow, I wish for massive protest. City are ruining football imo.
Comment: The rest of the PGMOL will be in attendance at the Etihad. They're getting a guard of honor from the City owners.
Comment: What in the nonsense isthat headline, OP?
Comment: Everyone knows what they are.
Comment: The record books and media should collectively put an asterisk next to Manchester city's name if they win the league this season. Its ludicrous teams that are fighting relegation take their hits and this team have done all they can to delay and deceive the fa. Should have docked points just for being shady in the first place.

Comment: Let's just wait until we hear the verdict. Constant news over the slightest bit of development is just boring.
Comment: 115 FC
Comment: That is a hard to read headline, OP
Comment: Looks lets be honest. They are going to get away with it. They wont be relegated or have any point’s deducted. 

Its most likely they will face transfer bans which is bollocks tbh.

Man city are where they are because they cooked the books. Its not rocket science.
Comment: That is a fucking dreadfully written headline. It makes basically zero sense.
Comment: A 'Mr' would have really helped
Comment: I know those are English words, but that isn’t helping the headline make any more sense
Comment: 
They’ll do anything but take action.

Comment: Dean Henderson playing brilliantly today has to be fun for United fans
Comment: NF lol.
Comment: Truly a fantastic match thus far.  Seven extra minutes added.
Comment: this has been such a great match so far. was not expecting this.
Comment: Happy for them but frustrated with Antonio there
Comment: What a great match tis one was. Surely the best so far of this early PL season. Congratulations to NF.

Comment: I think they’ll survive but at present, they’re a team devoid of any confidence so they need results and fast.
Comment: 56.8%
Comment: There’s definitely 3 worse teams than West Ham mate you’ll be absolutely fine.
Comment: I dunno mate but watching you is weird, I don't get how it's going like this.
Comment: Ask Charlie and Smiv as Charlie still says they are massive 🤣 #ontheroad
Comment: Depends on how Southampton does in the following months. It's either them or Southampton.
Comment: So many top quality players who have already proven themselves. The whole thing is very strange. They should be fighting for top 6.
Comment: Pretty much certain if they continue to let Moyes trot out the same lineups and tactics that haven't been working for over a year now (in the PL, they are oddly competent in Europe thus far)
Comment: We need nine wins just to get to 40 so...

Comment: It's just their turn, our massive injury list is shrinking at last. Hopefully we capitalise on it
Comment: I think Kudus is a bigger miss
Comment: RIP our season.

Hopefully Moyesiah has some tricks up his sleeve.
Comment: We were really beginning to see that Bowen - Paqueta - Kudus front 3 click, it was becoming formidable for a defensive minded team.

Alas.
Comment: Just hope he’s back for the Europa league important games at this point
Comment: This guy is a perfect midfielder man i love him
Comment: A shame, he’s a fun player to watch
Comment: Damn shame for West Ham

As a Liverpool fan if i could have one midfielder from any other premier league club it would be this guy.

Comment: Paqueta and Bowen out?
Comment: Not surprising at all, moyes keeps playing him even though he’s injured. It was obvious him hamstrings were fucked when he was playing against arsenal, but he still started.
Comment: One can only hope, Cat Kicker Kurt out!
Comment: Is a drop in the team creativity a given?   
His stats this season are 0.3 Assist per 90 min, 0.41 G+A.
Comment: They were due to regress anyway, they have been over performing and achieving for most of the season. This ofc will play a part if they do.
