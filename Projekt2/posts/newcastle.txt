Comment: It's most likely because of who your new owners are, which makes supporters of other clubs feel that your upswing isn't by "authentic" means
Comment: Because you're owned by some of the worst people on earth
Comment: Google Sports Washing
Comment: No one disliked them before the new owners, but since then the Newcastle fans have become unbearable. Not quite as obnoxious as arsenal fans, but they’re getting there.
Comment: Most people actually like Newcastle, and most people in the South, like me would tell you that we mostly prefer Newcastle to Sunderland. There will be the few people who have disliked Newcastle more in the previous year due to the fact that Saudi’s took over the club, I understand why they don’t like huge oil states taking over football clubs as it just makes it more into a money game and who can invest more money, becoming a bit of a cheat.

This season, Newcastle are the richest club on the planet, have barely invested in the squad like City or god forbid Chelsea and are on the cusp of qualifying for Champions League football which most people didn’t predict for the Toon this season. Incredible achievement with a likeable squad, fanbase, fantastic stadium and a great manager like Eddie Howe at the helm. 

The only people hating Newcastle will of course be Sunderland and Middlesborough fans, as well as some who are very anti Middle Eastern oil states taking over football clubs.
Comment: We were everyones 2nd club before we started doing well/ got taken over ...
Comment: Oil.
Comment: I thought they were one of the last truly working class clubs at the top level and I respected that. I didn’t like what Ashley was doing but selling your soul to the devil wasn’t the only option. 

I think it would be a little more tolerable if some Newcastle fans were just a little more genuine about how shitty their new owners are rather than trying to defend what they’re doing or playing whataboutery. 

Like I’m glad you guys didn’t end up getting relegated but there’s now almost this make believe that the rise up the table is some kind of fairytale. 

It’s all just feeding into exactly what the owners are trying to achieve by scooping up a football club.
Comment: Really like Newcastle fans tbh, same as Man City fans (pre glory days ones). All the ones I have met have been great.

Think you are just getting hate because of the new ownership.
Comment: Can't speak for the whole fanbase obviously but I like Newcastle fans. Massive loyal fanbase for both home and away games and anytime I've met any in town before/after a game they've always been sound.

They've suffered a lot over the last few years (and I've been following city for 30 years so I know a lot about suffering) so it's nice to see them doing well with a great manager at the helm and a good group of players.
Comment: I think it would probably have a lot to do with the owners. If you put the owners to the side though newcastle is a proper club with amazing fans. I feel they deserve this after Ashley and what he did to the club. You have bought smart and have a very likeable manager who has made the players he had better and made very smart signings (if you take Gordon out the equation). The owner issue will always create hostility although I think newcastle fans are better at acknowledging the owners history than others
Comment: Very weird, considering I hardly saw any shit towards Newcastle before the takeover, nobody really paid Newcastle much attention before that for years because you were sort of irrelevant, pretty much like a Crystal Palace. I don't mind Newcastle at all and don't see them as a 'rival' but I'm looking forward to Newcastle being a lot more competitive as shown with this season.
Comment: I wouldn’t even take any notice all the money in the world is not one bit clean
Comment: Bc they aren’t a traditional powerhouse and now they are crashing the party.
Comment: I have only had horrible experiences with their sets of fans, but I'm willing to keep an open mind. Also, I wouldn't consider us rivals just yet and it's nowhere near a derby, but both sets of players do seem to have a bit of a fire lit under their respective arses when we do play each other. The matches last season were especially contentious. I know one reason Newcastle fans don't like us is because of Pickford being a Mackem, however I have yet to see another good reason.

Comment: I really don't get it. I understand gambling can be an addiction but I genuinely don't get risking a professional football career for a few punts.
Comment: Absolute joke if he’s bet on Milan games
Comment: Yet football will still be covered in betting sponsorship.

Can the sport practise what it preaches?

Still, silly bloke he knew rules and still broke them. Idiot. He will have a lot of making up to do to the fans.
Comment: A lot of people desperate to defend him because “he’s got an addiction” 

Every player in history will claim they have an addiction when found to be breaking the rules 

If you don’t say you’re addicted you’re getting a 3-year ban 😂 it’s a no-brainer 

It’s no different to pleading guilty or insane court to get a better deal/sentence reduction
Comment: Wonder what this does to Newcastle's top 4 chances
Comment: Why are politicians allowed to play the stock market but pro sportsman can’t bet on sports?
Comment: Just as expected, a ridicolously low sentence.
Comment: And just like that certain fans have become passionate about tackling gambling addiction.
Comment: Very sad.. he is a fantastic player
Comment: Far too little tbh.
Comment: Claim it’s an addiction and get sympathy, dude is a professional footballer betting on football, be interesting to find out if he bet on himself, though I would suspect a bigger ban if that were the case
Comment: How much did Toney get?
Comment: Anyone think Milan knew and cashed in?
Comment: Arriverdverci

Comment: Still think Newcastle come out on top here
Comment: Not sure I buy this idea that Milan knew and that's why they sold him. If it's only around a 10 month ban and he was the future of their team would that be enough to prompt a sale. Could it just be they really needed the money?

Comment: Newcastle has lost so many points in the final 20 minutes this season..
Comment: One of the best games all season. I don’t think we’ll see 5 better goals come from a single game. Gordon’s especially, I thought he had no chance to score there, then Bernardo with a heel flip, and Bobb with a croqueta on Dubravka? Insane man. 

Oh, and KdB of course.

Comment: "Barcelona are interested in pushing out winger Raphinha."
Comment: I very much doubt we are. This sounds a lot like agent talk.
Comment: He was a great player for Leeds, he was a superb professional who gave his all for the team.
Comment: Oh it's that time of year again already is it?
Comment: He'd be an improvement on almiron . I think a great buy for 40-50m I think.I'd like him at man united over Antony tbh
Comment: Chelsea legend
Comment: Barcelona hasn't even paid off his transfer fee yet smh
Comment: Something tells me that ffp won't allow this. Good player though.
Comment: Getting the Leeds version of Rapinha to upgrade Almiron would be amazing and make perfect sense haha 

For that reason It's unlikely it'll happen.....
Comment: Barcelona fans hate him because they got so used at having Leo, Neymar and Suarez as their players that seeing players in the team that doesn’t compete for ballon dor is not normal to them even if the player contribute solid stats in its own way. When you look at Raphinha stats he is the best winger that Barcelona has and provides better numbers than a lot of elite players by minutes played. There is few wingers with his numbers and those that have better numbers are worth over 100 million so I don’t understand either how selling him is a good idea. Who you will bring that provide the same numbers for that amount of money. Barcelona fans need to accept the reality and they always complain and never provide solutions. Who you will bring?
Comment: Part exchange for Almiron
Comment: If there’s any actual chance he leaves Barca and Tottenham don’t seriously pursue him I’ll be very disappointed.
Comment: Howe would never
Comment: It would be good, his style is very premier
Comment: Bye bye Raphinha 👋

Comment: Please take him
Comment: I'd take him
Comment: Would be a great addition for many PL teams, but mainly as right midfielder in a flat 4. He is not performing well for Barca as a RW - at least not as good as you would expect.
Comment: Oh boi I’m so happy we did buy this fraud 😂😂😂

Comment: The totalitarian regime of referees needs to end.

It doesn’t matter what manager it is or what circumstance.

Having a position of authority that openly and actively punishes criticism of it is abhorrent.
Comment: As a Gooner I understand that rival fans will most likely laugh and think he deserves it. Fair enough, I get it. Just remember, and you've all seen it before:

It will happen to you
Comment: It's funny because they spent two weeks doing PR for that goal, before releasing the audio (which raises another set of questions about their decision making) and then patting their self on the back that they made the right decision before deciding to fine him.
Comment: Arteta comments certainly “weren’t nice”. The FA can go fuck themselves
Comment: As a wise man once said:

"I prefer not to speak, if I speak then I am in big trouble."
Comment: Corrupt FA strikes again

I back freedom of speech

I stand with Arteta on this
Comment: Inb4 the Newcastle fans who will be all over this thread, acting like its a moral victory for them. Nought to do with you
Comment: Officiating has been shocking across the board this season. Fining a manager for bringing it up instead of providing any sort of update on their plans to improve the standard of officiating just comes off as extremely tone deaf.
Comment: > "It's alleged that his comments constitute misconduct as they are insulting towards match officials and/or detrimental to the game and/or bring the game into disrepute,"

Well, I think the officials themselves deserved to be insulted and they themselves bought the game into disrepute. And I don't think that Howard Webb's propaganda exercise with Michael Owen this week has made the PGMOL look any better, since they refused to share the audio of the decisions that Webb himself admitted they got wrong, only the ones that Webb claims were correct.
Comment: What a clown world we're living in where criticism and offending the poorly performing officials are deemed abhorrent? 🤡 = FA
Comment: Fine for telling the truth.
Comment: Meanwhile Anthony Taylor officiates PL games
Comment: Banning criticism means they will never improve. It's why the standard of officiating has been shambolic for so long.
Comment: FA are the biggest snowflakes on the planet
Comment: This is censorship. The refs are clearly shit and I don't care how nicely they talk on the audio releases. they are still awful at their jobs and need to be held accountable
Comment: Nothing dodgy about waiting two weeks to charge him after the audio has been released and the FA inexplicably ruled the goals should have stood. 

Keep saying it the PGMOL are exercising their power and laughing at us all.
Comment: How about imposing fines against Refs after a conclusion is reached they botched the match. How can a league expect to be professional and maintain integrity with these errors? I'm on Arteta's, Klopp's, and DeZerbi's side on this issue
Comment: It's entirely possible to believe both things are true: Arteta was out of line with what he said *and* he was right that the referees and VAR have certainly left a lot to be desired this season. 

Arteta knew what he said would incur a fine. He said it anyway. Of course the FA fined him. No one should be surprised. He knew what was coming and was willing to (literally and figuratively) pay the piper. 

That said, I have seen more competent officiating in professional wrestling this season. I've stopped watching American football because of lousy officiating; I really hope it doesn't come to that with ⚽ but if the people who run it aren't going to take the sport seriously, why should I?
Comment: So players and managers can be criticized but refs can’t? What a joke 😂
Comment: The only thing bringing disrepute to the game is the referees ever changing interpretation of the laws of the game. 
Using terms like subjectivity or “clear and obvious” to muddy the water and make sure their mates always have an out when they fuck it up. 

Getting tired of Howard Webb and his regime, guy was a shit referee that had to apologise more than once when he had to ref every week and now he’s running the whole thing! absolute disgrace.

Comment: Back to the bi-annual Barca have no money and massive FFP issues so everyone is up for sale and is linked with every half decent club that needs XYZ positions
Comment: No thanks! Call us back when he’s about 7 years older
Comment: So really this is Barcelona are trying to push Andreas out.
Comment: Barcelona really needs to start being a bit more subtle in the way they leak made up shit to journalists.
Comment: Why doesn't this mention he's a former Chelsea defender?
Comment: No chance Newcastle pay his wages. Non starter
Comment: He supposed to be quite good no?

Comment: This is awesome 😎
Comment: Why would Christensen go to Newcastle or United. That’s such a step down for him. Makes no sense. He’s not that bad a player and he’s not desperate.
Comment: Why?
Comment: This and the Raphiniha news are all bullshit reports, I don't know why so many of you are so gullible to believe anything that's posted and not do your own research. Where are the Mods
Comment: It's a shame for these Barca players who the club are trying to force out. It has been a good move for Christensen and I can't imagine being undermined bu the board will be great for his development.
Comment: Waiting for Laporta to either put a Go Fund Me account to pay for Barca’s electricity bill or him selling a bunch of “guaranteed future Messi” from the academy to cover the travel bill.
Comment: the most underrated and under appreciated player in the world right now

he rarely puts a foot wrong and is one of the best ball playing defenders atm, and his security and calmness with the ball is incredible
Comment: Is this the drunk driver? We already have enough drunk drivers on our team no thank you
Comment: The mind boggles how United think they can attract players that are half decent when they have the option or alternative to go to that is doing better

Comment: Kudos to Spurs for giving these shirts a true stress test today
Comment: They must be buzzing
Comment: This is awesome and good on Newcastle for balling out today and making the experience that much better
Comment: This is a brilliant idea, though I don't know why they added the electric shock for a goal overturned by VAR. 
Comment: They must have been buzzing after the big win
Comment: In my mid thirties and this made me mildly emotional haha, must be going soft 😩
Comment: Newcastle just stacking Ws.
Comment: Take them to the Etihad, they would think the shirts are broke
Comment: Fantastic initiative.

Rumour has it that City are thinking of implementing it for fans who _aren’t_ deaf to give the Etihad a better atmosphere.
Comment: Electric shocks when the opposition scores.
Comment: A silver lining to the battering.
Comment: That's a really great idea and hopefully other clubs will follow suit.
Comment: That's cool as hell. I remember seeing a video of an Atletico Madrid fan who goes to the games with his brother who's deaf and blind. He tells him what's happening by drawing signs on his hands with his fingers.
Comment: I love this initiative. I'm sure it'll make so much of a difference for deaf fans to feel part of the atmosphere
Comment: A really wholesome move, fair play to them stuff like this makes it the beautiful game
Comment: They would have had plenty to enjoy after a good performance and our contrasting awful one.

Lovely idea to get every fan more involved in the atmosphere .
Comment: [removed]
Comment: Imagine they have an undergarment version.
Comment: Does it come with matching pants?
Comment: Respect.  🫡

Comment: He should call it a day and retire imo, 1000 game milestone, 8 million in the bank, free from all the media trouble, can finally have his retirement life
Comment: 8million consent
Comment: However you think he's been treated, it's clear that Steve Bruce is not a good enough manager for what Newcastle want to achieve this season let alone where they want to go over the next few years. Their squad is better than 3 points from 8 games.
Comment: Well he's bound to get another Premier league job straight away because he was doing so well at Newcastle, right lads? Right?
Comment: Mutual con$€nt
Comment: Let’s hope Steve doesn’t have to pick his severance cheque up from the Saudi embassy
Comment: Fuck me dead, took em long enough
Comment: I imagine him runny away from the stadium as fast as that Fifa glitch
Comment: This is pretty risky from Newcastle, if the team starts to get even more disjointed and unsettled they could be adrift before the January window opens. though they are in precarious position in general since its not clear Bruce could keep them up if they continue as they are.

So i guess this is the right thing to do. Its early enough in the season for someone to come in and keep them up
Comment: Damn, he didn't even get sacked
Comment: I wonder who they actually get now. 

Like would a top coach actually go there with a strong risk of relegation? 

I guess the one thing that is good is any new coach has a decent amount of time to assess the team ahead of the Jan window, I can never understand teams that sack a manager in January. 

Only problem is if they take a risk on a coach they could end up relegated anyway and that puts an already tough project on hold for another year minimum.
Comment: Any word on replacement?
Comment: 8 M paycheck is rather mutual. However comes in needs to have Prem pedigree otherwise they risk going down.
Enjoy the retirement Stevie.
Comment: Steve Bruce to @lukeedwardstele: “I think it might be my last job. It has been very, very tough. To never really be wanted, to feel that people wanted me to fail & saying I would fail, that I was useless, a fat waste of space, a tactically inept cabbage head”. ⚪️ #NUFC

now this is sad.....
Comment: The truth is that his record merited a sacking. The results and performances have been very poor and we have looked both unorganised and lacking in ideas. 

In truth, he walked into a situation where the fans were very pissed off over the loss of Rafa and seeing him being succeeded by what we saw as a mediocre replacement. He never had the support from the stands from day one and wasn't given the resources to succeed by the owner.

As harsh as it has been for him, a change was desperately needed, but I wish him well and have a quiet respect for the dignified way he has dealt with the constant pressure.
Comment: I kinda wanna see if he would do better than Ole at United with a super squad.

Give it Brucey till the end of the season.
Comment: Heard ole is available please
Comment: ZIDANE TO NEWCASTLE?!?!?!?!?111 /s
Comment: Guessing the new owners want to get a new big dick manager in like city did with pep
Comment: He has said that the fan negativity effected him and his wife’s mental health. Hope he is okay 🙌🏽

Comment: Don't Newcastle fans boycott Sports Direct anyway?
Comment: Biggest take away from that was they are paying £16 a top from Adidas. That’s some mark up
Comment: He really is a sad, petty man.
Comment: Surely Newcastle are actually doing Sports Direct a favour here because no Newcastle fan would ever buy a shirt from there, so really all this is doing is stopping them from ending up with a load of unsold stock.
Comment: Claiming they undercut other sellers is a bit of a push by Ashley here. It’s been ages since I’ve seen a shirt for any team cheaper in SD than I can get it elsewhere.
Comment: > He said if Newcastle fans were unable to buy their kits at Sports Direct then they wouldn't buy other goods there either and "may never come back", with people "losing faith in the credibility" of the store.

Aye because when I go into that place looking for my Newcastle top, I also look for Dunlop socks and Slazenger trainers. (I don’t go into any of his shops!)

Fuck off Ashley, you petty cunt! You wanted rid of the club and you got rid of it, you can’t continue to profit from it now!
Comment: Were Newcastle kits available anywhere other than Sports Direct when Ashley owned the club?
Comment: Also ignoring the fact that SD has consistently broken embargoes on Newcastle stuff, leaked new shirts and sold it before the release date etc. 

If people need cheap shit sports gear, then plenty of people in Newcastle still buy in SD… but I can’t imagine any Newcastle fan wanting to buy a shirt there
Comment: True Newcastle fan wouldn't set foot in SD.
Comment: He can gan an boil his heed. He's just a FCB.
Comment: Outside of any exclusivity - can we just address the SD pays clubs with Addidas as the manufacturer £14.95 per shirt!

That's a ridiculous markup on what we buy replicas for.

Comment: Petty from both
Comment: They hated the club being used for free advertising for Ashley. 

I'm sure similar sentiments will be applied when Saudia Airlines offers 100m kit deals.

Comment: Almiron didn’t want to move, so Al- Shabab didn’t submit another improved offer. It wasn’t because Newcastle’s ‘valuation’ wasn’t matched.
Comment: Is it too early to call the Saudi league experiment done? Almost a billion spent in the summer but the only major signing so far this window is Rakitic.
Comment: I was kinda hoping we’d sell him. As much as a love his attitude and workrate, he’s reached his ceiling and every defender in the league knows his moves by now. I wouldn’t mind him as a backup/sub option tho.
Comment: PIF don’t own Al-Shabab. Definitely not above reproach, but this probably isn’t the place. We arguably sold ASM under value while others unloaded players/wages last summer at a premium. Wait until we actually do something sketchy otherwise it all gets watered down.
Comment: False flag. 

Longstaff to Al-Fateh for £100m incoming

Comment: Even Saudis wont pay 30 mil for him. Reeks this.
Comment: Is this just a ploy for the Saudis to help the Toon’s books look better? Weren’t they having to sell to stay within FFP?
Comment: This doesn't make any sense, both clubs are owned by each other lol.

Comment: That ship has sailed.
Comment: That away kit is so terrible. Shouldn’t be allowed as an away kit considering how similar it is to the home kit, clearly designed for the above reason
Comment: LOL yeah so selling clubs to rich Saudis is fine despite their horrible human rights record, but just don’t wear their colours. Bit late to suddenly start growing a conscience
Comment: Duh, why do they think PIF bought the club? It's not cause MBS had a poster of shearer on his wall as a kid.
Comment: I’m against sports washing. I also hate financial doping. Newcastle should not, for those reasons, use those away kits.

Having said that, those look better than most of the weird away kits I’ve seen in the last 10 years or so. Someone should wear that, maybe a club not currently owned by a murderous thug?
Comment: I HATE repressive dictatorships and oligarchs financially doping clubs.

BUT isn't just like any other sponsorship, where the club or other sport teams take on the sponsors brand colours?  I honestly appreciate that Newcastle isn't hiding the fact that they're owned by Saudi. That way people know, they're financed by blood money.
Comment: I find it funny that ppl are baffled about the fact that money can buy everything on this scale! And it's not just the KSA, no one cares what you did if you keep flooding the banks!
Comment: My position is that it's distasteful, but also that colours on  an away kit are not imbued with some magical property. Seeing Dan Burn in green and white kit isn't going to reverse my opinions on the House of Saud.  It doesn't matter how much money the PIF pumps in to the club, that buys not one drop of goodwill from me. The money spends, I acknowledge that, and the club needs investment, but frankly I'm happy to siphon  cash out of the PIF and grow the club until they are inevitably sanctioned out of ownership and we've expanded to the point where we can attract another big money deal to replace them.
Comment: And if you need any evidence that it’s true, look at any number of the threads on this across the top football subs.  
  
Newcastle fans are all in on this ride.
  
EDIT: Look, it’s fine if you’re a Newcastle fan and you’re against it, but the fact of the matter is that I have seen comment after comment from those with Newcastle flair downplaying the whole thing. Some even welcoming it.  One person is too many.
  
Alone, it’s just a shirt - but if you can’t see the clear message it sends, I can’t help you.
Comment: Oh please god no. Make your money off of the club, sure, but don’t fucking strip it.
Comment: From a design perspective - Castore makes ass ugly stuff, and this is no exception. Also, any team that wears black and white stripes should have no need for a white away kit.
Comment: Didn't PSG do the same? If so did Amnesty make the same conclusions?
Comment: My F1 interest is showing here, but in the 70s the Williams team, sponsored by Saudi Arabia Airlines, had some minor [hints of blue on the car](https://s3.amazonaws.com/scardigest/wp-content/uploads/F1-Williams-FW07-04-Side.jpg), and the livery was quite nice.

The kit looks bland as it is, so I'd add a bit of blue and do a pattern/design change to give this kit some life and excitement.
Comment: The ownership to begin with is sportswashing, this is just an example of Newcastle being particularly shameless about it.
Comment: Does it matter, it a fucking away kit, if they had changed the home kit I could understand the argument.
Comment: Let's be legit here, we've had middle east promotional spam in sports for a while with PSG being the main one I can think of.

Don't forget that social media is full of paid influencers and dick jerkers spamming "visit Dubai" or "come to Saudi" type propaganda.

I mean shit, they even bought Zack Effron for a movie.
Comment: Newcastle is now nothing more than Saudi tool to boost exports lol

Financial doping… low-key wish City and Newcastle could fuck off to a Super League so the rest of the non-cheaters could compete fairly

Comment: Eddie Howe.  
Good Players.  
No European Games in mid-week.
Comment: Stability for the first time in a long time. A great young manager with fresh ideas and good recruitment in the transfer market.
Comment: Simply put …… Eddie Howe
Comment: The Saudis have told the squad that Steve Bruce is lined up to replace Howe if they don’t get European football next season.
Comment: Because Howe is a very good manager. 

Has he spent money?  Yes.  But right now players that were already there are playing well.
Comment: Because they are a good side with a good manager
Comment: People will tell you it's all down to money, money has played a part, but the main reason is Edward John Frank Howe

Listen to his episode of the high performance podcast and you'll understand why.
Comment: Grealish opened his mouth and Almiron didn’t let it slide
Comment: Good manager. Big budget. Smart transfer business. Style that’s repeatable week in week out. All round solid team.
Comment: Howe and Potter are two managers that I feel would do a good job with England, to be fair. 

They’ve recruited smart, they haven’t thrown a lot of money at players and players like Schar, Almiron and Joelinton have upped their game drastically. 

I have a lot of respect for Newcastle especially after having Mike Ashley for years and they have such a good fan base from what I’ve seen so far so hopefully the money doesn’t turn them too smug haha. 

The only issue they have is the lack of squad depth, but as long as January goes well for them, I can see them staying top 5 this season considering they don’t have a big drop of form next year, but it would be a nice change to see an underdog make Europe for once.
Comment: As a Newcastle fan, the reaction of fans of other clubs here is refreshing. Howe is very good, we have recruited well too and - yeah - spent a fair bit of money. 
I have a season ticket, what was most clear under a Bruce is the team were not fit. They collapsed in last 15 minutes a lot.
Comment: Definitely not money. Eddie howe redemed many old players giving them new roles and confidence.He clearly spent on what he want and how he wants to play. Also no midweek games is massively helping them. A fa cup and top4 is definitely in their hands . Those who are thinking that they go down after the world cup they wont. Many players are not in the world cup squad they will get ample rest and some new ideas and tactics will be praticed and implemented on the pitch.
Comment: EIEIEIO
Comment: And security. Everyone in the club knows they're only going upwards. The whole place, down to the tea lady, has a smile on their face
Comment: Good coaching and good recruitment. For once.
Comment: 1) Because they are playing well thanks to new additions that have hit the ground running. Nobody was expecting them to turn the income into results this fast.

2) Liverpool, Chelsea, United and Spurs are having patchy runs.
Comment: We’re forcing teams to play our way now rather than lining up to counter other teams - and it’s working. We’ve been losing for a total of 6 minutes or something this season, and it’s down to Eddie Howe’s tactics. Of course it’s easier when we’ve signed some better players, but let’s not disregard how vastly improved some players are and how incredibly supportive our fan base has been. I’ve had a season ticket for 10 years and never seen st James park as bouncing as it is this season.
Comment: I am a newcastle fan and watch nearly ever game, and i would say its down to 3 things.
1. Eddie howe has done amazing
2. The mood and optimism around the club is at a far higher level than before and people are actually happy and excited instead if sad
3. The signings of key players like trippier and bruno have added immense amounts of creativity and leadership that the club desperately needed
Comment: Eddie Howe.

Guimaraes.

A balanced team.
Comment: Best manager in the world after pep and klopp.

Can beat anyone with our style, just need the extra talent to push for a title.

Downvote me all you want you know it in your heart to be true.

Comment: They look like a completely different squad compared to the first half of the season, major credit to Eddie Howe and the players for stepping up.
Comment: I think change of system plus adding some really good players have helped them a lot. I always liked Eddie Howe. It's good to see, he is doing well
Comment: They really do. Around Christmas everyone had written them off to go down
Comment: I mean say what you want about the new players not being that important to their recent success,

You can’t tell me that the club isn’t more motivated to win after replacing a terrible owner with owners with unlimited money, bringing in a new manager that is liked by lots of people, making 6 (I think) signings in the January window, summing over £70  million at least.

Newcastle fans and players actually have something to look forward to at the club and so that is why they are playing better.

I’m not trying to take away from how impressive their recent form has been, but is anyone at all surprised after the takeover?
Comment: Until the Saudi support of Russia starts to taste bad in everyone’s mouth.
Comment: [removed]
Comment: Lots of saltiness in here tonight! 😂
Comment: It's such a complicated situatio, bc Newcastle fans really did deserve to be free of Mike Ashley and have some investment, but the investment'source is highly dubious.

Regardless, give the money to someone like Daniel Levy or Ed Woodward and they would've spent more and badly failed probably, so the recruiting was on point. At the same time, give these players and squad to almost any manager right now arround the Relegation spots, and they probably would struggle a bit, so Newcastle deserve much credit for their upturn in fortunes
Comment: We're witnessing why sportswashing works in real time.
Comment: Signings aside. Eddie needs massive amounts of praise. He's turned the dressing room around!! 

Regardless of players brought in he's got them playing!! 

Also. BIG DAN BURN!!!! GOT THE PREM IN HIS POCKET!!!!
Comment: People crying about money being spent but let me tell you as a Man U fan spending lots of money doesn’t always make a difference if you spend it poorly on players who don’t fit the club.
Comment: Cheers. 

Money doesn't guarantee success (Fulham, Everton, QPR). But on the other hand, the club's that win the most spend the most money, it's the way it is.
Comment: Sportswashing... Literally. Newcastle fans twerking for their Saudi daddies, when deep down they know if they had waited a few more months they would've bought Chelsea for pennies instead.
Comment: Even without Joelinton we're fucking class

Howay the toon ⚫️⚪️⚫️
Comment:  *finger crossed* Don't make me like Newcastle,  don't make me like Newcastle, don't make me like Newcastle.
Comment: Fair play to Eddie Howe, Newcastle might become a serious challenger within a few more transfer windows based on what weve seen so far under the new owners.
Comment: I thought Newcastle was dead even after their signings. Credit to Howe and the players for what they've done, staying up will only accelerate their progress
Comment: Howe-y the lads!
Comment: I think in a season or two they will be challenging for European spots
Comment: Dead and buried until the Saudi money saved their season.

Comment: Honestly well deserved. 

Congrats geordies, it's been fun to watch.
Comment: Give us the save of the month as well you cowards
Comment: As an Atlanta United fan, I love that Miguel Almiron is doing well with Newcastle
Comment: So much money is left on the table if no one gives him a boot deal with the tagline “play like Almiron”
Comment: Also an Atlanta fan and I can’t help but be happy for Miggy succeeding at Newcastle.
Comment: Absolutely spot on! Well deserved!
Comment: Can anyone confirm in history which teams/player combo have won all 3 in a single month before?
Comment: Fully deserved too, they've been excellent!
Comment: Unreal and well deserved
Comment: Good things happen when you aren't managed by Steve Bruce, and some of the talksport  pundits claimed Howe wasn't a upgrade on Bruce when he replaced him? lol.
Comment: Not a fan of this club but I do hope they dont fall off a cliff, atleast not this season. Would love to see other teams other than the top 6 to be a consistent top 6.
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: Why Budweiser? I have never seen alcohol sponsors on any kits or around stadium sponsors. Why choose to put one here, and why not go more local. Budweiser is such a trash beverage, but yes I understand they have the $$ to sponsor anything on the globe.
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: Do the awards go straight to Arabia Saudia, or they stay in Newcastle for a while ?
Comment: Now dissappear
Comment: great to see the geordies doing well,they will never win atmosphere of the month in that library

Comment: You guys would have made crap Romans. Decimation would be 10.
Comment: 8 different scorers and no penalties either
Comment: Last thread got deleted for being low quality so decided to just up the  Opta tweet, since that changes things apparently...
Comment: Decimation? I think you mean Octimation
Comment: It had only happened once before the premier league era I think with Liverpool against Crystal Palace. Palace ended up surviving and got their revenge at the end of the season beating Liverpool in the cup semi final, so something for Sheff U fans to maybe hang on to
Comment: Anyone still unhappy this was at 16:30?
Comment: Bruh, what happened to Sheffield to give up 8
Comment: Sheffield has just been relegated.
Comment: pure class man honestly
Comment: Newcastle scoring 8 against a Sheffield club in the Premier League is not unprecedented.
Comment: Im so glad i watched the full game. It was super exciting til they showed the stadium clearing at 4 nil then i started to feel bad. Then 6 nil came and they showed the home fans one more time and oh my god...then i saw that lady reading the book and i felt really bad.

Btw the snot shot close up was awesome. It was the only satisfying look on a sheffield player today
Comment: If we manage for a 7 nil bashing in December at Kenilworth Road, I'll take that. Realist.
Comment: Can't argue with that achievement. To score 8 no matter who against is fantastic to do it with 8 different scorers is just mind-blowing
Comment: This game was absolutely fucking bonkers.
Comment: Just watching the highlights. Why was the first goal not taken away for a clear handball by gordon? Have the rules changed?
Comment: I thought I hit the HDMI button and was watching FIFA
Comment: United looked terrible obviously.

Selling their top talent has pretty much secured they will go straight back down to the Championship.
Comment: Decimation is the removal of 10%…

Comment: More of an octamation?

Comment: This is a bullshit article, The owners,fans and players love Howe. Trying to create a meltdown that isn’t there
Comment: The only people calling for Howe to be sacked fall into one of three categories:

- Those who don't watch Newcastle games
- So-called Journalists
- The brain damaged
Comment: No sensible toon fan wants him out, the man has earned more than enough goodwill. In Eddie we trust, we will overcome
Comment: If the owners sack him they will have lost their heads completely
Comment: If he gets fired it will be one of the biggest mistakes I would have ever seen in the Prem.
Comment: There’s people in this comment section that clearly have no clue how Newcastle have been operating since Eddie took over and don’t understand just how much of a positive impact he’s had on not just performances, but the back room and our players mental health. Fair, you might not follow the club, but then you’re in no place to make an accurate comment.

The people that don’t think he’s good enough to win something after taking us to a cup final last year and giving him one season in a group of death in the UCL need to reassess themselves. Only the worst fans want to ditch their manager after every small slump.
Comment: Wow, The Guardian wrote a negative Newcastle United article.
Comment: This is wild with the amount of injuries Newcastle have had.
Comment: "Journalist" have short memories by trade. But I remember last January was also pretty rough for us. It was also around match week 21 then when we went 5 straight without a win. And then what happened? But a bit of drama makes for a better "news" cycle. 

Short of falling into a relegation scrap, Eddie is fine. He's earned it through until summer of 2025 to see what he can do and build up to. With the same caveat.

Comment: The people that put this kind of nonsense out need a reality check, Newcastle have punched well above their weight considering most of their team consists of mid table quality players, the league is just returning them to where they belong, they are not a top 6 club and they'll be a team that occasionally gets Champions League football
Comment: So the common wisdom is no Newcastle fans want him gone. I know 2 who are saying they think the pressure is on and I know 1 who's wanted him gone for a while now. I'm not saying I agree with this but I do think some people are starting to doubt and if that's the case now how many more will start to think that if we go without a win for all of January? It's a very real possibility considering our January fixtures consist of Liverpool away, Sunderland away, City at home and Villa away. This will leave us with 1 win in 11. Of course if he can get results anyway there people will no doubt praise him.

I don't agree with giving Howe the boot, especially without a viable alternative lined up, the guy overachieved in his first half season and then again his first full season. He's earned enough good will with me to right the ship. Having said that the club was here before Eddie and it'll be here after him. I think Newcastle fans can be a little overly sentimental. Sometimes it's necessary to part ways.
Comment: Wander what it must be like to be a journalist and have pride in what you investigate and write, only turning out a load of recycled unfounded hypothetical shite? 

“Tiredness and injuries may be a reasonable excuse for Newcastle, but is the situation really worse than at Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea, Brentford or Brighton?”…. Yes
Comment: God I hate how the media circle like vultures
Comment: When a team not used to success start not succeeding: 😱😱😱😡😡😡😡


Firing this guy would be the mistake of a century
Comment: Only reason I could see Howe being fired is if the club can get a manager who is more well known globally.
Comment: Ever since Newcastle were taken over I’ve said they will have Jose Mourinho in charge by the start of the 24/25 season and I’m sticking to it. 

Won’t be surprised to see Howe replace Southgate at England in a mutual decision to leave Newcastle where everyone gets what they want.
Comment: Fuck off Media with your fake stories, stop trying to ruin peoples lives with your shit ‘reporting’
Know what it is as well if Eddie or a player went into meltdown the Guardian would be the first to jump on the bandwagon of poor humans look what you’ve all done to them! Ever since we were taken over we’re now Guardians number 1 enemy..
Comment: The media keep trying to push this narrative and not one sensible newcastle fan believe it. They must be fuming at the office wondering why their usual tactics aren't causing a meltdown
Comment: Sunderland fan stirring stuff up. Rubbish

Comment: Between him and Isak, the vultures have certainly started to circle New Castle. It’s going to take longer than I thought for them to get into the upper echelon consistently with the new owners.
Comment: Will be us or Arsenal to get him. Don’t see anyone else having both the money and the ability to win him over. Rodri-Guimaraes or Rice-Guimaraes is seriously formidable.
Comment: Really strange to have included even 1 month from may to june?
Comment: It will be a massive mistake to let him go anytime soon. Newcastle have managed to build a great team. They should let it fall apart.

Comment: If you want to be a top team isn’t the point not to sell your best players anymore? Regardless of money.. if he’s happy then you leave it
Comment: Deserves to be on a title winning team. The guy is world class

Comment: Newcastle fan here, I think yes we have spent a lot just over £200 million in two windows the clubs owners clearly have a idea of how they want the club to progress, however I don't think it will be immediate and will take many years to get to City's level.

Next summer will be very interesting as the fun88 sponsorship ends then, it will be interesting to see who the club gets as their main shirt sponsor and how much money that will pump in
Comment: Man City’s early cash injection came at a time when the Premier League was significantly weaker than it was in the mid 00s. Summer 2009-2016 was probably amongst the weakest in terms of league strength over the past 20 years. It was a time when nearly all of the World Class talent was split between The European Giants particularly Real Madrid and Barcelona.

2009-2013 The Premier League’s Top 2, Chelsea and United had a lot of their best players ageing and they weren’t signing World Class talent as frequently; hence why Ferguson’s last 2 title winners were considered significantly weaker than what came before. City were able to make a lot of great signings without too much competition - Silva, Yaya, Robinho, Tevez, Aguero etc.

Whilst they paid top, dollar they wouldn’t have secured most of those signings if other teams were willing to match the money. Newcastle have found their riches in a time when the Premier League is at its very strongest both in terms of quality and finances. Where as City had to compete with a Top 4 that had Liverpool and Arsenal on the slide (plus an occasional Spurs challenge), Newcastle are competing with a Top 6 who are all happy to open their wallets and already stacked with talent.

Whilst the money available means Newcastle making a ‘Big 7’ is a virtual guarantee; winning titles and qualifying for the Champions League will be a significantly tougher task than the one City faced.

With 7 big teams we could end up in a situation where a lot of top players choose to head to European Power Houses again so they can virtually guarantee Champions League football every season rather than risk slogging it out amongst 7 big clubs in the Premier League. This will depend on financial stability returning to the European Giants; but this is when Newcastle’s inflated chequebook can make all the difference.
Comment: With enough money thrown at it any club could be the best in Europe/world. Newcastle are technically the richest club, and by some margin. I think it's a matter of when, not if for Newcastle.
Comment: Yeah of course but it will take at least another 3-4 years to build up to that level.

In the second half of this decade i'm almost certain they will be a big threat.
Comment: Jose Mourinho will manage Newcastle soon.
Comment: It's not can they, it's how long will it take.
Comment: It's certainly the ambition of the owners but its going to very hard to even break into the top 4 let alone win the league. I know it's early days for this season but Man City, Liverpool and Arsenal are probably going to be the top 3, Spurs, Chelsea and United will be fighting it out for 4th - 6th. Going to be difficult.

Should add that I don't expect us to crack the top 4 this season regardless of how competitive it is up there I'm just saying that going forward I don't see any of these teams dropping out of the top 6 so trying to get to the top of that is going to very difficult even with money.
Comment: It will take longer than Chelsea or Man City for two main reasons:
1. Man City were a top half club when the take over happened. Took them 4 years to win a title. Newcastle were in relegation zone during the take over. It'll take them longer.
2. It's incredibly hard to break into the big six. In City's time, it was a big four but none of them were winning machines like Pep's City or Klopp's Liverpool.
However, what will be the state of affairs in 5-6 years, we can't say.
Comment: yes, with money you can do anything so i don't see why not, there is no magic besides money, what made Real Madrid and AC Milan the 2 best teams in history is the fact they had lots of money and were able to get the best players, having a good reputation that makes more great players want to join, after the economy took a big hit you saw Italian teams and AC Milan going down and not winning a champions league again, Milan at that point was the second with most UCL titles (still is but might be overtaken) that caused Juventus to be the absolute League ruler because by being owned by the family that owns Fiat they didn't face the same financial problems.

That is why money makes teams win, might take some time but that's how it happens, if Barça didn't give such huge € contracts you can bet half the players would't have gone to play there and they would't have kept Messi either, sad truth.
Comment: I think people overlook how holistically City have spent their money, it’s not just been on players, it’s been on facilities, the surrounding areas of the stadium, staff, proper upper management. The people off the pitch have been just as vital in not only maintaining current players, but making them feel like they belong as well. 

The owners are now starting to make money back, but they’ve also bought clubs all over the world to build a brand which is stronger than the sum of its parts.

It’s never been just a case of pay more for better talent and become a better club, it has been an MCU-like plan & 10 year vision, which we’re now in the 14th year of.
Comment: In the modern game, money is everything. 

There's no finite price on player values, someone's worth as much as someone else is willing to pay (I'm a Manchester United fan and I'm thinking Antony, who's not "worth" anything like £85m, but that's what the club were willing to pay to get him.) So in theory you could outbid the other big clubs for any given player, and the owners can afford it. 

The problem is going to be FFP. A lot depends on what kind of sponsorship deals they can secure over the next few years to circumvent FFP rules. Saying that, UEFA state themselves that: "Clubs are permitted to spend up to €5 million more than they earn per assessment period (three years). However it can exceed that level to a limit if it is covered by a direct contribution from the club's owner." I'm not sure what that current limit is, but there's clearly some creative accounting going on at clubs like Manchester City to get round this. 

I read somewhere recently that Manchester City's owners have a net worth of around £12bn, whereas Newcastle's owners have a net worth of around £300bn, which is 25x more. Newcastle also maintain brilliant support, still averaging around 51,000 attendance every home game despite struggling, relatively speaking. 

I've no doubt whatsoever that within a few years (or even sooner depending on the profile of player they can attract) Newcastle will be competing with the biggest clubs in Europe. These owners haven't battled so hard to buy the club to just be also-rans. 

TLDR: Yes.
Comment: Can the richest team in the world, who have been a bigger name and more money than City, pull a City? 

It's not about if, it's about when.
Comment: It took Man City over a billion and few years. Perhaps. But that’s the price.
Comment: Yeah easily with money
Comment: In theory. Maybe. 

It’s a long way to the top. It would require years of investment with a pretty high success rate in the market and a bit of luck and momentum. 


As a fan I’m just here for the ride. I’d love to see us disrupt the top 6 a bit.
Comment: I will say, the fa seem to be taking ffp a lot more seriously with them, which shows they don't want to allow another man city to come about, if you ask me
Comment: It's not about just spending money. It's spending money the right way. Newcastle have the money now but will have to spend it the right way and invest in the right assets and then maybe they could be a top team in the future.
Comment: ...so the owners of Newcastle have something like 200 times as much money as the owner of Manchester City.

Yeah. They absolutely can.
Comment: Look at PSG, they bought a lot of world.class players and still they cant win anything other than weak French league... You need great manager, teamwork for big success, tou can buy 10 Mbappes but still they wont work because its real life, not FIFA game
Comment: If invested wisely they can reach great heights, already impressed by their signings K Trippier and Bruno Guimares and also Alexander Isak.

Comment: Let’s thrash City

We got a new derby the Oil derby
Comment: Can we donate players?
Comment: Bold of you, to assume we will beat any of those teams.
Comment: Villa are playing both City and Liverpool still, as well as Burnley twice. We will make many friends and many enemies in the next few weeks.
Comment: We’ve not won away at City in the league since 2000.

We have only beaten Arsenal once since 2005.

We need to lose against Burnley to get Everton relegated.
Comment: Hot take: They win all 3
Comment: I will become a part time Newcastle fan if they win against city
Comment: Influence. Not decide.
Comment: Newcastle is Sir Gideon the All Knowing.
Comment: There are going to be a lot of Newcastle fans over the next few weeks
Comment: We'll lose to Man City, the last time we got even a point at the Ethiad was 2007. Definitely lose to Arsenal, they take 6pts from us every season regardless of form. Probably a draw last game of the season, have a feeling Burnley will have nothing to play for on that day either.
Comment: New castle United has all the power
Comment: Newcastle now is your chance to shine and put a message that you are the real oil club. Please oh god please beat/draw against city
Comment: I fear Newcastle away more than the NLD. They are going to pull our pants down, i can sense it.

I pray that we beat Leeds and Spurs before that game because it's essentially top four wrapped up if Lpool beat Spurs
Comment: Hopefully they lose all 3.

Stops Liverpool getting title and possibly Quadruple.      
Keeps Tottenham out of top 4.     
Relegates Everton or Leeds.
Comment: They also played Liverpool just this weekend just gone!
Comment: Wolves too, yet to play against Man City and Liverpool.
Comment: We shall see.
Comment: I'm hoping that 4th place will be decided a week from Thursday with an Arsenal win over Spurs before they even play Newcastle.
Comment: Man city: L


Arsenal: W


Burnley: L, relegating Everton

Comment: Yes
Comment: They’re in great form right now and they don’t have to worry about UEFA competitions unlike most of the other teams that will be also competing with them for the European Spots. Barring injuries I’d say yes they will get a European spot for sure
Comment: I could see them making but I can also see them not making. So maybe
Comment: In my opinion I think they get 7th at the minimum. Way better team than West Ham. 


I also think they could sneak ahead of ManU or Chelsea for 6th but let's see
Comment: Definitely can see them getting Europe whether that’s UCL or not is a different discussion tbh
Comment: I’m worried about a lack of depth to deal with fixture congestion and to cover injuries. I also think Liverpool will find their form at some point and get into the top 4. I really hope so. Been a long time since I saw us play in Europe.
Comment: Yes.

I'd say they finish top 6 at least.

Hope Brighton also get conference league at least, as a neutral that loves the prem, these are the two most exciting teams ATM for me.
Comment: I think it’s more a question of which European competition they’ll qualify for.
Comment: I'd be happy with europa tbh. And I don't even care if we win it but I'd love to see us back in Europe and testing ourselves. 

Was talking to a mate earlier and he's assuming with our above expected success so far that we'll invest heavily this January transfer window and make a push for Europe. Our "5 year plan" might turn into a 2 or 3 year plan. Be daft not to use this momentum and take advantage
Comment: I cant see them finishing outside the top 10 and I imagine they’ll push for the european spots all the way. There’s strong competition tho as those are the spaces it looks likely that Yanited and Chelsea are going to occupy and I think it’s unfair to write off West Ham this early
Comment: My prefiction was yes. They finish 5th or 6th


City

Arsenal

United

Chelsea

Tottenham

Newcastle

Liverpool
Comment: Wilson will get injured for 3 months. Miggy will eventually lose his hot streak. Chris Wood will get more game time. I don't think we have the depth to stick it out. If we can hold on in and around the top 5 until January and we get reinforcements then maybe... maybe I can dream. But realistically right now, I think 7th or 8th is most likely.
Comment: Eddie Howe is doing a great job there.

I can’t see them not getting into Europe to be honest. I think they’re a few years off CL spots, but that’s going to happen eventually.

I think they’ll finish in and around sixth. 


God knows who’s gonna finish in the top four, Liverpool are only eight points shy so you can’t write them off. If anyone benefits from the WC it will be them.
Comment: They don't have the distraction and fixture congestion as the "big six" but I don't see their current form continuing. Maybe Conference or UEFA if they're lucky.
Comment: It's tough as Chelsea are a bit out of form, Man United have been getting results but they've not been very impressive. Arsenal still have Chelsea, Westham, Brighton, Newcastle, Tottenham, Manu United in their next 7 games. Tottenham are losing a bit of confidence. 

The only teams with consistency at the moment are Man City, Arsenal and Newcastle, so think they may do one better and finish 3rd.

Isak and St Maximin still to come in. Shelvey is back, and provides great support if Bruno ever gets injured.
Comment: Maybe not so hot take but newcastle are going to be in the race for title contenders in the next 2 years if they make UCL they can attract big players and ofcourse have the financial backing to do so Their projects seems to be very positive and can be sold to players..
Comment: They're not gonna finish below 7, so conference league awaits at the very least.... but yes i do think they have a good shot at finishing top 6, and a slightly lesser chance to do top 4
Comment: None of the oddsmakers seem to think so and they're never wrong...
Comment: If they get conference, I can deffo see them winning or coming close
Comment: How many of their players are gonna be active at the WC? Not many I'd guess. Should give them a boost given a lot of the players from the bigger clubs will be. 

And given how well they are playing and the confidence they have o reckon theyve got a decent shout. City, arsenal, spurs and Chelsea look to be the competition so it won't be easy. But as I said, the WC will change a lot

Comment: He does it because referees or FA in general let him. Simple yellow card would solve all the problems.
Comment: Even as a fan of the club, I know he does that shtick too much. Other clubs have hyperactive exaggeration types but...yeah, Bruno needs to calm it down a lot.
Comment: lol

Meanwhile on Sky we've got Gary Neville keeping quiet.
Comment: Bruno is brilliant from the ankle down
Comment: Someone upload and link please
Comment: As a former ref I fully believe in football karma. Bruno Fernandes is getting all of the football karma and the refs obviously know it.
Comment: I love Graeme this gave me such a laugh watching
Comment: He got in the refs face because he wanted a corner not because he was asking for the penalty. Either way Graeme response was spot on.
Comment: Rat of a captain
Comment: I think ETH makes Martinez or casemiro captain next year after letting Maguire walk. I get the respect for Bruno, but goddamn is it hard to watch the flopping and moaning from this grown ass man.
Comment: We're still soft and crying for fouls with every touch if we were in 7th I'd be raging
Comment: Baffles me that he is captain over the likes of Rashford, and Varane.
Comment: He gets away with way too much. He definitely gets the award for biggest rat of the PL.
Comment: Zodots
Comment: like I have said many times....Bruno has such talent but would love to  read his leg on the pitch
Comment: I hate the rat and get massively downvoted and called a traitor every time I say it here.

That being said 1. although it was not a pen he didn’t flop he really did get clipped 2. he was complaining about it being a corner - which it was - and didn’t make too big of a scandal compared to his usual self.

The comment was well placed though.
Comment: The weekly Bruno post by rattled fans......I don't condone his behavior especially since he's our captain, but this obsession is just laughable now.
Comment: Didn’t you just loose 2-0 to villa? I would keep quiet for now mate. At least we won when it mattered most

Comment: Glad that after the ESL shitstorm and making sure we gave football back to the working class we’re back to the regularly scheduled programming of trying to sell clubs to shady Saudis because who really cares about human rights violations as long as it’s your team that signs Mbappe
Comment: "Total goods exports from the UK to Saudi Arabia in 2017 were worth about £4.2 billion, an increase of 120% compared with ten years earlier. Goods imports from Saudi Arabia were worth £2.4 billion (also more than double the figure for ten years earlier). So the UK had a surplus of £1.8 billion in goods trade.

The top UK export categories were various types of machinery, aircraft, arms and vehicles, including £280 million of cars.

Oil accounted for more than half of the imports from Saudi Arabia, including crude and refined products. Other goods included machinery and electrical equipment, and photographic, cinematographic and medical equipment." From BBC. 

So we are ok to do business with shady Saudis, but they can't buy a football club?

Before you ask, yes, I'm a Newcastle supporter.
Comment: At this point why don't the Saudis just buy a Championship team without PL oversight and build from there.

Bristol City is an amazing place and with the kind of backing the Saudis would plough in would soon make an impact, what about Nottingham Forest, immense history to build a new team from.

Newcastle just isn't worth the hassle while they are in the PL.
Comment: Personally, I think the Premier League should relegate them (a Fulham supporter).🤣🤣🤣
Comment: I’m in favour of the takeover cos I’m a selfish fan and want my club to be worth supporting but yes it’s conflicting and tbh we just want Ashley gone. Im not in love with the Saudis but we’ve had 8 failed takeovers and there’s not much we can do as fans either way, we’ve wanted Ashley gone for 15 years and he’s still here so we are pretty voiceless in that regard. Are there any ‘good’ billionaires? Fuck knows but none of them want to buy our club, Ashley wants to sell and doesn’t want any more to do with it...so this is our lot. I see people bringing up the shit the Saudis do which is fair but why is that being spun like we can do anything about it? Direct your anger elsewhere ie the UK government who is in bed with them.
Comment: Trade you 3 Glazers and a washing machine for Mike Ashley
Comment: People sometimes ask why I'm not more outraged about the fact that our club could become a "channel" for "sportwashing", whatever that actually is. Let me explain...

&#x200B;

I've spend the last 10+ years of my life with a hole in the place where there was once true enjoyment for the thrill of football support. It's been complete and utter misery.

That misery hasn't come from he fact that we're not winning trophies, it hasn't come from the fact that we don't always have the best players, it's come from the fact that our club is run like a business.... and not even a good business. We're run like a Sports Direct, and who actually enjoys going to Sports Direct?

For season after season, we have been laughed at, ridiculed, and ignored...take your bloody pick of ridiculous comments about our attitude towards expectation and and stick them on a roulette table, then spin it every week. Rio Ferdinand, a man who sells his own range of active-gear at Sports Direct, can be front and centre for this one, but we can come back to that.

Year upon year, we have shouted and sung about our terrible owner abandoning the club, doing *just enough* to keep us in the premier league, never giving much back to the community, never giving back to the fans, not investing a single penny into the club yet also essentially syphoning money away from the club using his holding companies, prefferred partners and free advertising, allowing the training and youth academy to become a complete joke... our club has gone from one of the top 20 wealthiest clubs in Europe to a joke.... and yet no-one takes us seriously when we tell them, WE WANT ASHLEY OUT.

Now, on the tail end of the super league fiasco, we see fans of other clubs all crying out that their club isn't being run in a way that they like... how about you let me borrow one of those massive trophies and a few pairs of Pogba's socks so I can catch your tears, soak up the spillage and feed them back to you?

...and we can come back to Rio Ferdinand... mr, "why don't you club together and buy the club yourself"... mr "it's his club, why would he invest in players that will get injured", Mr "they should say thank you"... who is now proclaiming that it's outrageous that an owner should dare to go against the desire of the fans...

It's not just him, but he's by far the biggest hypocrite of the lot.

Which is it, lads?

Are MUFC and the other, "big 6" special, and deserve special treatment, or are you part of the greater football hierarchy that we should protect at all costs?... Pick one, you \*£$%s, then apply it evenly.

&#x200B;

But now, new *potential* owners come along, (and to be clear, this is a consortium of UK based business people that are financially backed by the Saudi's public investment fund, it isn't just, "the Saudi's") they want to put all of those things right.

So now... apparently, after being largely ignored by the footballing community, and the media about something we wanted to change, after being told we're now just a yo-yo club and should accept our position, being told we have delusions of grandeur... NOW... **NOW....** just at this exact point...  suddenly you think it's also reasonable that NUFC fans all have to carry the moral burden of the financial backers?

&#x200B;

How about you go and shove it up your arse, mate.

We had no say in the matter for the last 10 years and no one gave a damn. We also don't have any say in this, so why should we give a damn what you or anyone else think?

Go take your moral outrage and shove it right between those stupid little cheeks, and keep it up there.

I'm no fan of the Saudi state, never have been, I think you will find a lot of NUFC fans would admit to feeling some conflict over the matter.

I lost a job because I refused to go there, but if you think NUFC fans could or should fight  against an organisation that will, at the very least, allow the club to  realise it's footballing potential... you're more deluded than you  thought we were.
Comment: So glad as the arrogance of the Premier League is massive
Comment: This is a great cause and a superb opportunity for Newcastle United to finally win something.
Comment: Can someone explain please?
Comment: *Wins 2-4*

Comment: Is the answer bucket loads of cash? It’s bucket loads of cash, isn’t it.
Comment: Don't even have to read the article to know what happened. Probably a 5 minute negotiation. NCU matched Milan's 1st demand with buckets of money within a minute, then the remaining 4 was Milan attempting to pawn off Caldera with days left on contract.

NCU: "Hey Milan....  that young generational Italian player that wants to spend his career with you, that your fans totally adore, that you could build something around... He available?"

Milan Owners: "Caldara? Yes. €20m?"

NCU: "Huh? No, Tonali....  How much?"

Milan Owners: "€80m."

NCU: "Done."

Milan Owners: "We'll also throw in Caldara for packaged €90m???"

NCU: "No, he's shite with days left on contract"

Milan Owners: "€85m???"

NCU: "No, please stop. €80m for Tonali and I'll be back for Leao next summer."

Milan Owners: "Perfect ! Like my dad always said! 1 step forward, 2 steps back, as long as you make money along the way, its Ooooook !"
Comment: Tonali being a die hard Milan fan, growing up admiring Pirlo & other great Italian midfielders & being the talent he is, you would never have thought he would leave Serie A ever.

Now yes a lot of teams in Europe need money and need to sell there best players but Tonali leaving was never on the books for many football fans whether Premier League or Europe.

The fact he is moving and moving to Newcastle is a MASSIVE. This is a statement from Newcastle without doubt. Not only does getting Tonali push Bruno.G more forward, but you get a potential world class level, European football experience and potential leader into your team

What a move. Well Done Eddie Howe & Dan Ashworth.
Comment: Yes we weren’t expecting it but no one was thinking that a team that finished 4th in the prem wouldn’t be able to land him

He’ll be on loan in Serie A within 18 months.

Comment: Great, now Newcastle can send that 30m over to Arsenal for Tierney.
Comment: Dam gonna miss him at the prem, even tho he’s not world class he feels like he’s just outside of that class of player and is so entertaining to watch as a neutral.
Comment: The Saudi League is a cancer to football
Comment: **From The Telegraph's Luke Edwards and Mike McGrath:**

Talks have been ongoing for several days and a deal is set to be completed imminently, with the funds set to lead to a breakthrough in Newcastle’s pursuit of Leicester City’s Harvey Barnes. The England international should be on Tyneside for a medical this week.

Saint-Maximin will not travel with the rest of the Newcastle squad for their pre-season training tour of the USA and has said his goodbyes to teammates and staff.

The impending departure of one of the most entertaining players in the Premier League and a crowd favourite on Tyneside, who was vital in keeping the team in the top flight under former manager Steve Bruce, brought an emotional tribute from Newcastle manager Eddie Howe.

Newcastle would have liked to keep the player but needed to sell someone to help them pass Financial Fairplay rules.

“It’s difficult for me to comment on what Allan wants,” Howe said after his team’s 2-1 friendly win over Rangers at Ibrox.

“I respect him immensely. I know he feels the same way as I do about the football club. There’s no issue between us.

“We have had a really healthy relationship from day one. Sometimes things have to happen for the club to grow and Allan to experience something different.“You can’t replace him with a similar type because there is nobody like him. “I don’t think there has been an issue with work-rate.

“You say industrious. But in his way he is really committed to what we asked him to do. Last season was difficult for him, he picked up a couple of injuries so I don’t think we saw the very best from him. The Man City game was Maxi could be for us on a regular basis. Nobody is doubting his talent.”

Comment: MBS selling a player to MBS £30 million, as others have pointed out - great for the FFP limits.

I don’t see any way that this is acceptable to the PL or to FIFA but being the money hungry pussies they are, they won’t make any sort of fuss.
