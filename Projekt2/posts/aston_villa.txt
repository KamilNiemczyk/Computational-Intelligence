Comment: As a Spurs fan I'd be delighted to see Villa make the CL - for a club of Villa's size it's a travesty that it's taken until now. Slightly annoyed that it would be at our expense, but if that's the way it works out I'll be ok with it, there's always next year.
Comment: Unai Emery and Villa players have been excellent this year. Considering the fact that Stephen Gerrard almost ran Villa into the ground, Villa deserve top 4 and I hope Villa get it
Comment: If they didn't hit a slump they actually would be in the title race and that is insane. Beating City and then Arsenal back to back is nuts
Comment: The supercomputer had them fourth at the start of the season.
Comment: Villa has done well but they're quite far from the top 3. If the top 3 win their game in hand, villa will be 11 points behind and with 4 games left to play, that is a huge gap to close. The top 3 are in their own race and this doesn't diminish what villa has done so far at all villa as they have much smaller budget compared to the top 7 teams + Chelsea.
Comment: Unai Emery is a class manager.
Comment: They‚Äôve spent as much as the top 3 bar city
Comment: Yeah, it's quite easy to find 10 or so points in games we should have won but let slip. Shows the quality and consistency needed to win the prem.
Comment: Villa have had a ton of injuries - ACLs and season ending ones too.
Comment: Agreed, Aston Villa and Unai Emery have been schooling teams all year. Well deserved CL place if they get it (and I think they will).
Comment: We lost Mings, Buendia and Kamara to ACL‚Äôs. Had we held on in certain games (Man U cough cough) we might even be competing for the title.
Comment: They spent massively.
Comment: We've been slapping teams with our huge gentlemen sausage since the day Emery walked through our doors. We'll push again next season.
Comment: I always believed in Unai as a manager and felt that Arsenal fucked him over with their lack of support. Now that he has a well-funded team, he is delivering.
Comment: Agreed. They've been quality all year. Truly fun to watch.
Comment: It just goes to show what happens when you employ a top quality manager and give that manager time to settle in and start building a team.
Comment: I saw something recently that said considering there spending wages etc then Aston Villa absolutely should be competing for CL places. I didn‚Äôt look into it too much but they have consistently spent lots of money.
Comment: It's been an amazing season for Villa & Emery. The worry now will be the richer clubs trying to poach their players. If they can retain their core players & add a couple more good signings, they can very well establish themselves as a top side.
Comment: That‚Äôs having a tactician coach looks like. Unlike us, having an idiot incompetent coach ü´†
Comment: No real surprise...they've spent quite big ? Top 4 was always an achievable target but they've done great considering they've played a dozen plus games in Europe and our only remaining hope of conquering Europe albeit the Europa Conference...the summer will be interesting...Will Emery stay ? Will the players who've perhaps over achieved¬† stay ? Will Villa spend big again and try mount a surprise title challenge ? Villa fan's have loved this season but the team may be torn apart in the summer ...?

Comment: Premier league refs need to start post match interviews.
Comment: Reffing won‚Äôt get better until there is some accountability with the FA.
Comment: Yup. Its been a terrible day of officiating in the PL. First Chelsea and now City. Ridiculous decisions today.
Comment: We honestly need some foreign refs. Get Canadians or Germans idk
Comment: Time to start mic‚Äôing up refs and having them explain truly shocking decisions. More accountability needed.
Comment: Villa was definitely cucked. Such a shame the league with the best teams has the worst refs. Great game all around today.
Comment: Coutinho wouldn't have scored that goal had the ref not blown his whistle already

Ederson just stood there lol
Comment: I‚Äôve heard a lot of officiating issues today. But I think the overturned Newcastle goal may have been the worst of them. And I say that as a Palace supporter.
Comment: The worst thing about the Newcastle one was that they only showed the ref 2 angles of the incident and not the 3rd which blatantly shows willock being pushed and that caused him towards the keeper.

The two they did show were a little dubious
Comment: It‚Äôs going to happen to Arsenal tomorrow.. mark my words .
Comment: Maybe we could have some sort of video assistant that can help the refs out with things that are obviously to complicated....now, what should we call it? How about VAR?
Comment: Scenes tomorrow when McTomminay two foots Jesus, but out of no where Xhaka sees red for it!
Comment: Yes is was a bad call, but to be fair I think Ederson got that if the ref doesn't blow the whistle.
Comment: It was a bad decision ofcourse but i wouldn't call it robbed. I mean every city defender and ederson switched off after the whistle
Comment: Officiating has really been a disaster !!! Every single match it‚Äôs all over the place and why not raise your flag faster why let the game still be played and then raise it .
Comment: Not good for football.
Comment: # Hammers & Magpies have entered the chat
Comment: So u think Ederson would have had the same reaction if the ref didn't show offside?
Comment: So was West Ham
Comment: Amazing how fast a flag can go up when there's a threat to City's goal.

Comment: With all the talk about if spurs are in the title race and if arsenal have already lost it and if Liverpool can stave off Man City I didn‚Äôt even realize Villa were 2nd until they showed the table at the very end today.
Comment: Almost every AVFC flair I've seen on PremierLeague and Soccer are happy to not have the pressure and arbitrary expectations set by the media. They're just going about their business and it suits them down to the ground. People need to stop getting offended on behalf of other clubs.
Comment: We haven‚Äôt looked like world beaters of late, but I still don‚Äôt care about the disrespect. Every team that plays Villa is aware of the threat they pose. The only one of the top teams I am worried about is Liverpool because they have our number since the 7-2 beat down we gave them a while back. And there‚Äôs a good chance by the time we play them again it won‚Äôt matter anyway.
Comment: Welcome to "the rest"!
Comment: Don't think for one moment that Villa will win the league, just a bit rubbish that they are just ignored by the pundits. Currently above Arsenal and Man City
Comment: We don‚Äôt care. Let them write us off, it‚Äôs fine. Half way point and there appears to be five teams pulling away from the rest.
Comment: It‚Äôs ok to include Spurs as well. Ongoing injuries to key players in Defense and midfield for 2 months now, as well as some suspensions (which is the players fault, but still). Getting wins while playing a backline of fullbacks as well as missing the main creator in Maddison, couple signings in the window which are going to happen plus the key players returning, Spurs are absolutely in this as well by that logic.

Truth is that neither Villa nor Spurs have a shit at the title this year, Arsenal are almost out of it as well. This is shaping up to be a City-Liverpool title race.
Comment: I don't see it happening, but I will cream my jocks if Villa manage to win the league. It's the sort of ending we all romanticise about, similar to Leicester winning.
Comment: Honestly, can‚Äôt believe nobody is pointing out the david Moyes title charge either?!?!?! It‚Äôs a disgrace
Comment: That‚Äôs crazy bc villa park is probably the last place any team wants to play rn
Comment: What‚Äôs with everyone‚Äôs need for pundit recognition. Enjoy your teams performance lol
Comment: At the start of the season, if you had told me we'd be second in the table, through the group stage in the conference League, and unbeaten at home.. I wouldn't have believed you. I'm just happy we're up at the top punching around and taking points off the heavyweights while turning Villa Park into a fortress. I'm over the moon right now. I'm still keeping my overall expectations reasonable though, the thing I want to see from Villa this season is when the conference League, hopefully make a deep run in the FA cup, and finish in a European place again. The most important thing imo is to continually qualify for Europe and try to build on that to improve the club's position in the league to where we're considered a top half team.
Comment: lol I think I‚Äôve heard more talk about Manchester United than any other team, like they should be expected to be in the top four and it‚Äôs absurd that they are not.
Comment: Sky sports pundits are useless. It wasn't long ago they had Paul Merson on there saying how arsenal will win the league and they are cities only competition. They should be sacked if I'm honest. Why can't villa win the league? A few decent signings and I really don't see why not. I'm a Liverpool fan and obviously want us to win but its a long way to go yet. 

Anyone's game if I'm honest
Comment: I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs probably quite nice getting to go under the radar a little bit. Villa fans are in the fortunate position that they can just enjoy the title run in. In some ways Spurs fans can probably do that too, especially if they continue to just quietly stay in touch whilst their injury list clears up. 

My particular annoyance is that despite City‚Äôs dominance in recent years, Arsenal and Liverpool are both still expected to just ‚Äúwin a title‚Äù as if City aren‚Äôt constantly an obstacle to that. Until any team can consistently challenge them, the narrative shouldn‚Äôt change from ‚Äúit‚Äôs city‚Äôs to lose‚Äù.
Comment: I want Unai to win it. Supported him to the hilt since he left Arsenal so he could show them what a mistake it was. The Villareal Europa win was great, beating us and then Man Utd. Then the semis of Champions League.. Was wild because the next season they had no Europe at all and they were flagging in the league , then Newc came knocking , was furious about that,, and then Villa.. ok Villa. Its not Newcastle and the money and big ambitions but at least he is back in the door... Back in the door is right. And did not know about Villa billions.. So looking forward to the purchases.. yes I'm an Arsenal fan and I would have preferred to have won the EL.. but I just love this man, he is an honest, and a genuine football tactical manager who had to crawl his way back to the top. I would celebrate almost as hard if he won it. Most deserving out of any.
Comment: To be fair,we don‚Äôt play Villa again for months yet. By the time we actually play them again and they have any chance to impact any race for the title it could be over and done with one way or another already. 

Whereas we have an away game against Arsenal next month.
Comment: I‚Äôm glad we are being downplayed, it makes it even more sweeter when we do well. 

No Villa fan is delirious to think we will actually win the league, any top 4 position and champions league football will be an amazing outcome. 

Everybody knows Pep will go on some winning spree and beat everyone as usual.
Comment: I don‚Äôt give a shit. I‚Äôm just enjoying my football atm!
Comment: You don't fit the Big Six narrative, so you are forgotten about. Don't take it personal, they have to protect The Brand.

Whats that? You think acknowledging one of the "other 14" challenging the Big Six would enhance The Brand?

Oh sure, next you'll start considering yourselves as Big Six demanding Big Six TV money ans Big Six media exposure. But that belongs to the Tradional Big Six.

Know your place peasants!

Comment: I absolutely hate these child 'journalists' that keep alive this horse shit agenda of football being invented by Sky in 1992.
Comment: They‚Äôve won it before ü§£ wtf is this headline. It‚Äôs the same god damn cup lol
Comment: Well deserved. Emery was a nightmare for many top 6 teams, well done villa.
Comment: Manager of the season imo
Comment: Forgot football started in 1992
Comment: Honestly, I'm thrilled for Aston Villa. Emery is a terrific manager, and I just have to respect them for their wins over us this past season. Certainly they deserve it far more than a certain hapless, loser club I could name, one with fans who literally cheered getting scored against in their own stadium, who feared occasionally encountering banter over a chance to maybe earn playing in the highest level professional competition there is. Anyway, congrats to Aston Villa. You earned it!
Comment: Yeah but they already have 1 European Cup...well done Villa
Comment: Ummm....they won it in 1982.
Comment: ‚ÄúVilla have not reached Uefa's premier club competition since it rebranded from the European Cup to the Champions League in 1991-92.

They last played in the European Cup 41 years ago in 1982-83 having won the competition the season before.‚Äù

Is it really that hard to go in and read the note instead of basing your opinion on the headline?
Comment: First time? They have won it before
Comment: News outlets seek to pick and choose whether or not the European Cup counts as the champions league, it‚Äôs weird.
Comment: Bog off newbies, they‚Äôve won the European Cup
Comment: They‚Äôve already won it!
Comment: I get why it's worded like that, but it still seems weird considering Villa have literally won the European Cup.
Comment: Emery is an Alchemist. Gerrard Almost got relegated with this team.
Comment: Hmmm, r/theother14. 

They literally have a champions league cup in their tunnel. They have the same as Man City, Arsenal, Spurs, Newcastle have combined.
Comment: 17th when Emery took charge, finished 7th. The next year he qualifies us for the Champions League. I can‚Äôt wait to see what he does next. #UTFV
Comment: Is it just me or would Emery make a great James Bond villain
Comment: Well deserved
Comment: Unai Emery is like one of those Japanese city cars from the early 2000s.

No frills, rarely is a stunner, but efficient and reliable. Always.

Comment: He should have been Manager of the Season.
Comment: Hope this works out for both Villa and Emery. Great manager. Has put pride back in the team.
Comment: Sacked next season after a 'disappointing' 7th place finish. Nailed on.
Comment: Great news for Villa. 

If the club continues on this trajectory they could be a top 6 club for years to come. The city of Birmingham deserves this.
Comment: Don't forget, the longer the contract, the bigger the compensation would be if he carries on doing well and another club came in for him.
Comment: Congratulations to Unai! He's definitely brought back the pride in Aston Villa. He is an accomplished manager and if given the right parameters can do a lot for any club. Unfortunately, at Arsenal it didn't work out but I feel that was down to timing but for every door closed another one opens.
Comment: Arsenal and Emery supporter.  Villa locked down a quality manager and an even better human.
Comment: Fantastic news for Villa. Very good manager and I think they‚Äôll finish top four again for next season.
Comment: Im an Arsenal fan. I wouldn't trade Mikel for any other manager in the world. Having said that, I was so wrong and short sided when Unai was our manager.

Hes all class and he should have been manager of the year in my opinion.
Comment: Bold prediction: Not more than three years until Villa lift the league title.
Comment: Manager of the year by a mile.
Comment: Great news for Villa . They need consistency and with Emery given a long tenure he will have time to shape them well.  A domestic cup or a UEFA Trophy should be on its way.
Comment: Hope they give him a few signings that he wants and let him succeed with the extra games he has to play.
Comment: I‚Äôm way too envious! Stability is underrated‚Ä¶
Comment: Question for the boys‚Ä¶ IF Arsenal had kept Unai Emery would they have won more trophies than Arteta has?
Comment: Good for him.  He did an amazing job last year.
Comment: Good for him. In a way, Arteta showed that Emery wasn't the problem at Arsenal.
Comment: This is what it means to back the manager.
Comment: Best transfer window ever!
Comment: That's 5 Europa league in a row for Aston SeVilla

Comment: Stun? It was 4th beating 2nd, not 19th beating 2nd
Comment: Palace, who haven‚Äôt won since February, stunned today. Pretty common that a 4th place team beat the second/third placed team, wouldn‚Äôt call that stunning lmao
Comment: Title over now. City will win their remaining games, but even if they don't, I think both us and Arsenal will lose again.
Comment: Bayern will put the final nail in the coffin tbh. Our mentality dies during this time of the year.
Comment: Fair play to Villa. They were good. We weren‚Äôt.
City‚Äôs title to lose. Thoroughly depressing.
Comment: Congrats Aston Villa and Emery. Tactical masterclass tonight.
Comment: arsenal and liverpool fans went from "won our game so dc about other teams" to "praying for man city to drop points"
Comment: Arsenal probably should‚Äôve scored in the first half, but Villa DOMINATED in the 2nd half

I can‚Äôt remember the last time someone fucked us over like that. Every single ball and battle, Villa won.

They deserved to win, Arsenal deserved to lose
Comment: What will happen if Arsenal didn't win the league this season?
Comment: the ebening was bad for arsenal.
Comment: I think Aston Martin will finish top 4 now. I know Spurs have a game in hand but they have an incredibly hard run with Chelsea and Liverpool away, Arsenal and Man City. Maybe it's time that Mr Mate actually came up with a plan B instead of playing the same way every single game and expecting it to work against everyone. The definition of insanity ect.
Comment: As a fan of the team playing arsenal, when I see zinckencko playing at left back, and completely leaving the left villa right winger to his own devices so he can go and join midfield, I am so relieved.


When the opposition have the ball, he's such a weak point. Weak and can't really tackle, not great at following a man, not good in the air, not super fast.
Comment: You misspelled "beat down"
Comment: Arsenal fans love to big up King Kai, irony is if they‚Äôd signed a proper striker they would have wrapped the league up by now.
Comment: The annual Arsenal bottling has begun. 3 years in a row.
Comment: The worst part is now I also have to be retroactively upset about Liverpool losing, and at the time I kind of enjoyed it.

Aaaaarugh.
Comment: Did the double this season. Wow.
Comment: Thanks Geoff now over to Chris kamara with the weather‚Ä¶*looks out of the window*
Comment: I love what I saw today.
Comment: Stun? It's April.

Comment: Didn't they change it like 2 seasons ago?
Comment: It's the same logo?
Comment: Thanks Villa.
Comment: At least it's not the Chelsea B team logo anymore!
Comment: Drop shadow ü§Æ
Comment: Why do they keep changing their logo so often?
Comment: Why didn‚Äôt everyone just keep their old logo‚Äôs. The fuck.
Comment: Logo credits chelsea?
Comment: 1980s Peugeot
Comment: I couldn't even spot the difference. I need the old one put beside this to know it lol.¬†
Comment: Why couldn't they make it gold. Good grief.
Comment: Can‚Äôt wait for the 2025 version to drop
Comment: Wheres the old one i cant compare
Comment: Well they changed their logo and got UCL footie. So I guess they‚Äôre hoping for a repeat haha
Comment: So they kind of reverted back, a bit.

Good move tbh, the other one looked a bit too much like the Chelsea logo.
Comment: Good. Couldn't believe the decision they made to change to that generic circle.
Comment: Is this just gonna be a yearly thing?
Comment: Better than Maroon Chelsea
Comment: Shield > circle but is this really better? Do villa fans prefer Aston Villa to AVFC? It looks better on top too
Comment: I don't know why but the name being beneath the lion looks weird.

Comment: I guess Villa are qualifying for Europa and winning it next year.
Comment: Back this man, please. Always rated him from afar.
Comment: How the fuck did they pull that off? He must have thought he was being offered an Aston Martin & a Villa. Fair play.
Comment: That's fucking huge for villa. I bloody love all these top managers joining lower teams. 

Get pochettino at Southampton and get rafa back at evertonüëç
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: That's a pretty awesome move for villa tbf.
Comment: Jesus. Nice pull from Villa
Comment: Well done Villa , I‚Äôm not a supporter but I think you‚Äôve got a brilliant manager and hope you do well
Comment: He‚Äôs not a bad manager just wasn‚Äôt right for the demolition job we were going to have to do post Wenger.

While we‚Äôre at it, we totally need Jose to come back and manage Nottingham Forest just for the post game comments. That would be comedy gold.
Comment: This move makes no sense for Emery. Why would he join a relegation threatened Villa for anything other than more money. He left Europa League football and CL football for a relegation battle in the Prem.
Comment: I'm one of the few who liked Unai, a classy character and I think he will succeed at Villa. Good luck to him, except against us üòÅ
Comment: No comment
Comment: Top, top manager.
Comment: Well man united nightmare has returned
Comment: Did Gerrard slip again?
Comment: Very good appointment. An intelligent appointment too. Slippy was always a risk seeing in he managed in a poor league. Emery is a tactician.
Comment: They've done it, Villa have returned to European glory as champions of the 2023-24 Europa League
Comment: It's a no lose situation for Emery. Born Slippy spent an absolute fortune and left them worse than when Smith was sacked, it's impossible for him to do a worse job. They'll guarantee him funds and it's an easy improvement job to bolster his CV
Comment: Strange move. No offence to Villa but he certainly could've gotten a bigger job than that if he wanted!
Comment: Good appointment, and a surprisingly big name for where that club have been over the past decade.

Just can‚Äôt see it working out, though.

Comment: He deserves it. Every Villa fan out there will be happy about this.¬†
Comment: Fuck they're gonna win the league now
Comment: As an Arsenal fan I couldn't be happier for him. Knew he wasn't done as a manager when we spiraled out of control and it was clearly a mismatch with us, he's found his home with Villa. Can't be mad at that.
Comment: He's going nowhere until they've that statue built.
Comment: The way I interpret the title is Aston Villa contracted to Emery. Aston Villa has signed a contract to Emery.
Comment: Emery has done well for Aston Villa and deserves the contract extension.
Comment: Good he deserves it and what a job he's done.
Comment: He utterly deserves it tbh. Considering he has much the same squad that stevie g had and yet the output us near enough the exact opposite it‚Äôs an amazing body of work from him
Comment: He's not going anywhere!!! Unai Emery's claret and blue army will march again
Comment: Love this for him
Comment: One thing I can always say about the man is that he carries himself impeccably and with a lot of dignity. He was shit on by various clubs and players ( psg looking at you ) and has always been respectful. I'm an Arsenal fan, and his time with us wasn't the best, but that was always going to be the case with anyone who followed Arsene. I'm very happy to see him doing amazing at Villa, and people should give him the respect he deserves. Done an amazing job, and long may it continue.
Comment: Great, didn‚Äôt look likely to leave any time soon but nice to avoid a couple of months of speculation.
Comment: Excellent manager and comes across as a great bloke to be fair. Happy for him
Comment: Good for him. He's done a fantastic job.
Comment: Title makes it sound like Emery extended Aston Villa‚Äôs contract with him
Comment: Dub for both sides
Comment: All the other teams in the league: ‚Äúcrap‚Äù

Well deserved though¬†
Comment: Definitely not a case of

Emery Bored
Comment: So happy to read Esteban C√≥ogan will remain at Villa.
Comment: S√≠ very well. Good ebening

Comment: Don't worry, Liverpool still have Trent's "Corner Taken Quickly" card in the second leg. He just needs to do it 4 times this time.
Comment: All results are acceptable except Liverpool's
Comment: West ham could score 2 at home, maybe more. But I doubt they‚Äôll be able to keep a clean sheet.

That 2nd goal was crushing
Comment: Leverkusen 43 matches unbeaten ü§Ø
Comment: Form is temporary, class is permanent.
Comment: I‚Äôm hopeful for us and Arsenal. Us because we‚Äôll be at home, Arsenal because I think they have it in them to batter Bayern home or away.

Liverpool coming back isn‚Äôt out of the question either. Pretty unlikely though

And yes Liverpool fans, we know, Barcelona
Comment: Probably say it's only Liverpool that shat the bed. Other results are decent enough/expected
Comment: We were so shit tonight. 

Our highlights are probably on the hub instead of tnt sports.
Comment: The only really bad result is Liverpool's, I expected them to win comfortably. Obviously West Ham's isn't great but they were away at a very good Leverkusen team.
Comment: liverpool got bodied lol
Comment: I just had a Liverpool fan tell me that he legit blames the fans in the stadium tonight becasue they weren't waving their flags since they were protesting against the ticket price increase. That lack of fan waving is why Liverpool lost. Not the 6 changes made by Klopp as he grossly underestimated the strength of Atalanta.
Comment: Ironic as it‚Äôs villa likely to miss out on
Comment: Yea well Madrid, Bayern, a good leverkusen team and Atalanta???

I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a typo. No way this mighty Liverpool side at home didn‚Äôt lose 3 nil to Atalanta right?
Comment: To be fair West Ham had Leverkusen who are unbeaten all bundasliga
Comment: I won't blame West Ham for losing to the undefeated German champions. City going to Madrid and getting a draw is not embarrassing, either. Arsenal and especially Liverpool should be doing better, though. That Atalanta game was a shambles.
Comment: To be fair, Villa's opponent was a lille bit easier.
Comment: Well, England were level on coefficient points with Germany. So Leverkusen winning against West Ham probably hasn't helped
Comment: So much for all the English teams doing well so 5th place gets UCL next season

ü•≤
Comment: I'm a Liverpool fan, I didn't watch the game tonight, but was a tiny bit shocked when I checked out the result!
Comment: Brits discovering they been lied to about the prem being the strongest league in the universe

Comment: Counterargument: Gareth Southgate
Comment: Obviously Emery has never heard of Southgate...
Comment: Yeah I mean Southgate would be an idiot not to select him, barring an injury he should be a lock
Comment: I mean he will without question get called up, he will just get 0 minutes as he will be called up to be Kanes back up.
Comment: If he doesn't, just sack Southgate there and then.
Comment: He really should be the front runner right now to the Kane understudy role. The only person who is comparable in form and consistency is Solanke and Southgate won‚Äôt risk an uncapped player this close to a tournament.
Comment: Unless they play 442, there is no way to play him alongside Kane?
Comment: No sorry we‚Äôve already got Sterling, Henderson and McGuire so there‚Äôs no room left
Comment: He has been exceptional. I do hope that Villa get the 4th place and secure a spot in CL. They have played very well this season.
Comment: He is miles better that rashford but I bet he gets overlooked
Comment: Is he not going?  I would think he‚Äôd be the second option behind Kane.
Comment: Facts
Comment: Starting the obvious.
Comment: He‚Äôll be in the squad but he won‚Äôt get too many minutes.

I‚Äôm not a fan of getting worked up about squad players for international football. Some people get very angry if Southgate or the manager doesn‚Äôt take the exact same 23 man squad. For me, as long as all the players I would starter are going then I‚Äôm generally happy
Comment: That doesn't work for me brother - Gareth Southgate
Comment: He does, hes the best backup to kane but it doesn't matter. Kane will play every minute unless we're comfortably winning a group game so it really doesn't matter who his backup is.
Comment: I‚Äôd rather he isn‚Äôt picked. Our players end up getting tapped up. Yeah he would probably fetch close to ¬£100 million but how do you replace a player like that?
Comment: [removed]
Comment: His form this year has him in the running for player of the season. He's been immense and every season he's been with us he's continually gotten better.
Comment: He absolutely does. Especially with his explosiveness up front. I only hope Southgate doesn‚Äôt choose Wilson over him.

Comment: Theres no such thing as a title race or top 4 fight generally until january/february. Its too early to tell
Comment: Think people are being a bit harsh. The question is do they have an outside chance which I think they do. I don't think they will but it's absolutely possible.
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: Not this season, City, Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal are all stronger.
Comment: I could be wrong but I don‚Äôt think theyve played/beaten anyone who you would consider a top 4 rival yet (maybe Brighton). They are 3 points ahead of Newcastle, but Newcastle have played Man City away which is the hardest fixture of the season- probably need to see how they get on over the games up till Christmas.
Comment: Who‚Äôs your top 3?? Arsenal and Man City and ‚Ä¶ surely it‚Äôs Liverpool or Spurs
Comment: I don't know whether they will or not, but the fact that there's a few different teams all seeming like they might ruffle feathers at the top of the league is really exciting at the moment. It feels like the whole prem is getting a breath of fresh air. Brighton, villa, Newcastle, West Ham with their European success.

Chelsea and Man U also struggling more than previous years too.

Its all starting to feel a bit new and different and I'm loving it.

And its amazing I can find any joy in football considering I'm an Everton fan....
Comment: Maybe this is bias, and forgive me, but I don't really feel Villa have been tested. They've only really faced 2 top teams, Newcastle and Liverpool, and got battered in both.

Comparatively, Brighton, the other 'darling' of the other 14, beat Newcastle and held Liverpool to a draw.
Comment: I'd be happy with this season go cement European football, either 5th or 6th would be outstanding with going deep in Conference league. Aware 5th is champions league so that would be fantastic.

I feel just lacking a proper replacement if Watkins gets injured. Duran looks very good but he's long way to go. 

I feel this season there's previous "big" teams still rebuilding so there is a gap for a Villa etc so push up the table.
Comment: lol this thread is teaching me people are sleeping on Villa. Seriously good side and consistent too, they have every chance.
Comment: The "barring serious injuries" thing is worth mentioning, as a Villa fan.

We've had less than 45 minutes of football total amongst Moreno (our first choice LB), Mings (our best CB), Buendia (definitely part of our best XI) and Ramsey (probably our best player outside of Luiz, Martin√©z, and Diaby), and as it is we're within 2 points of the top. Mings and Buendia are out for the season but Moreno and Ramsey will probably be back before Christmas. Of course the flipside of that is that we're a couple more in the wrong areas - to, say, Luiz, Cash, Martin√©z, or Warkins - away from collapse.

We're still outsiders of course but anyone who isn't looking at us at the moment as at least UCL dark horses is kidding themselves.
Comment: I would personally say no. Yes, Villa's form has been impressive. They've had some spectacular games. But at best, Villa will finish in a Europa League spot. Villa can't compete against the "top clubs" just yet. 5-1 Newcastle, 3-0 Liverpool, and they've also managed to slip up to lower teams as well. I also find that Villa is pretty dependent on Ollie Watkins. If he get's injured, I doubt Diaby will be able to score all the goals that Watkins get for them.
Comment: Lets see what the table is looking like at Christmas and go from there.
Comment: don‚Äôt they have the 2nd best record of 2023 for the PL? id say a shot but a long shot at that given how strong the top 6 teams are
Comment: Villa are certainly in with a shout. Ever since Emery came in they have had Top 4 form
Comment: Who gives a fuck what a load of armchair wankers think.

AVFC.
Comment: We have a number of injuries to our starting 11. Mings, Buendia, Ramsay, and Moreno.

I fear if we get 2-3 more serious injuries it will be too much.
Comment: Why would it mean one of Spurs or Liverpool don't make it? What makes Arsenal certain for top 4? They are only 1 point ahead of Liverpool and could be behind Spurs after their game soon against Fulham.
Comment: It's too early to say, but yes, of course they have a chance. City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs, Villa, Newcastle and Brighton are all fighting for those spots. United and Chelsea could end up around there too. No point in making definitive calls on who could finish top 4 or not when there are so many teams in the running and we're only 9 games in.
Comment: they have more of a shot than Chelsea at this point.

Comment: These last few days the shit that transpired makes me question stuff. It was blatant, in your face, bullshit.
Comment: I miss celebrating goals
Comment: It's not VAR it's the referees being shit.

  
Genuinely wondering at this point if there's isn't possibly a massive corruption shitstorm looming. People laugh at these sort of allegations, but I bet they did in Italy or Spain before their scandals blew up.
Comment: Me not understanding. A total and obvious foul, not given by the ref. Went back and reviewed it, and fixed it. Isn‚Äôt this how VAR was a supposed to work???
Comment: It was a foul, VAR worked in this instance. The problem, as ever, is consistency. We've seen much bigger shoves/pushes/barges in the same manner that are ignored.
Comment: Although I agree it wasn‚Äôt a goal because it‚Äôs a silly push but the fact that there was two of the same incidents in the same game (First half shove from McGinn on Badiashille to make him go offside and was reviewed as offside but no foul) and the Disasi goal just flipped which team shoved who but was called as foul for Chelsea but not for Aston Villa.

Ref‚Äôs and VAR need to fix the inconsistency because it‚Äôs stupid now when same calls go different ways, they need clear rules.
Comment: I mean he's right. 

Leeds fan so been watching the Champooo and us bottle it in classic Leeds style.

I don't give a toss about the injustice when the ref gets it wrong. 

I go, "ffs ref" then meme the shit out of it and move on because internally I know it's impossible to overturn it. Personally I prefer it, if the linesman doesn't have it up, boom its a goal, it's the best. 

Compared to last season while we we're wank, it was just a general nightmare when VAR was involved and it seems to have gotten worse this season. 

It's just no fun.
Comment: It‚Äôs a 50/50 - Carlos backs into Badiashile, and puts an arm on him - but didn‚Äôt VAR say they‚Äôd give the BOD to the attacker? Didn‚Äôt they also state they‚Äôd only get involved if there was a clear and obvious error? It‚Äôs so inconsistent, and it makes no sense
Comment: VAR has not damaged the image of English football. Oil money, hyper-commercialisation, foreign state ownership, and City did the job.
Comment: Officiating incompetence and corruption damaged English football not VAR. That being said, it was the right call.
Comment: Almost certainly a foul (and in isolation a good use of VAR) but no idea how that meets their bar for clear and obvious given all the shit that is just ignored throughout the season
Comment: Only an idiot or stevie wonder thinks that's not a foul ..
Comment: It was a foul though
Comment: Man City being allowed to cheat their way to buying the premier league multiple times is the biggest stain on our beautiful game. Dock them points, fine them billions and just get them to fork!
Comment: It's a foul. Only problem about it all there have been so many decisions similar given/not given. Not to keep moaning about it but us v Newcastle, and I think Chelsea v Brentford something similar happened too. Probably Wolves too with the absurd amount of shit gone against them. 

All I want is some consistency in decisions, and adherence to the rules they create. 

But that's a pipe dream, every other game is ruled with controversial decisions as they are so fucking incompetent.
Comment: I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. It's the most nailed on obvious foul in the world. He shoves him out of the way and it directly leads to the goal. This is VAR working correctly.
Comment: Car isn‚Äôt the problem, the refs are the problem and i will die on this hill. You can‚Äôt have sports nowadays without replay. When the audience can see replays showing offside, penalties etc‚Ä¶ you need to be able to correct calls. But the refs are just shit and they run var
Comment: Music to my ears! VAR have screwed so many teams in EPL so far. No team is an exception.¬†
Comment: It was definitely a foul and I accept that and do not criticize the call at all, but he is right it is damaging the image of the game.
Comment: I wouldn‚Äôt hate var as much if it didn‚Äôt seem like city had so few of these controversial calls against them. Makes the whole theory of the refs that work over in the Middle East corrupt against oil teams kinda credible.

Comment: Gone are the days of the traditionally big clubs just pinching the best players from the smaller PL clubs.

If a big 6 team wants a top player from Brighton, Aston Villa, West Ham, or whoever, they have to now stump up the cash - just look at how Brighton have fleeced Chelsea in recent years, Villa selling Grealish to Man City for ¬£100m, or Arsenal paying West Ham ¬£105m for Rice. 

As far as I am aware, Aston Villa have very rich and ambitious owners. They won't sell their star players unless it's for a pretty penny. If Villa obtain champions league football this season then they will be in an even stronger position to keep their best players or to demand fuck off prices - even consistent Europa League football would be great progress for a team like Aston Villa considering where they were 5/6 years ago.
Comment: Recent dip of form, meaning 1 loss to Man Utd? Doesn't seem like much of a dip to me...
Comment: Girona has same owners as man city and Aston villas owners are pretty rich too. Not really comparable to Leicester. A better example would be Brighton who keep producing and selling talents to bigger clubs.
Comment: Leicester got relegated for a multitude of reasons. One of which is that they got uniquely fucked by the pandemic since their owner has a lot of money in airport duty free shops.  They sold well and reinvested well, until they didn‚Äôt 


As far as Villa goes, they have very wealthy owners, and with as many as eight English clubs getting into Europe, they‚Äôre an attractive destination. If I‚Äôm a top villa player right now, I need to think long and hard at whether a move to say arsenal or Manchester United is even worth it anymore, since I can get paid and get European football elsewhere
Comment: Did chatgpt write this
Comment: I mean we hardly talking about Fleetwood town or something here? Villa have the 7th highest 5-year net spend ahead of Liverpool and only 2 million behind city so they're hardly living off the breadline. 

And their current squad didn't come cheap so I think the whole argument is fairly unsound.
Comment: Yes? Aston Villa aren't exactly strapped for cash and there's absolutely no reason why they can't further strengthen under Emery.
Comment: Let me get my crystal ball
Comment: We‚Äôre not an upstart team. We are just returning to our perch
Comment: Yes. Potentially Watkins aside (and I still don‚Äôt see him going) I wouldn‚Äôt say they have any standout stars who appear to be doing the heavy lifting for the club and stand out as being ‚Äòabove that level‚Äô (like players like Rice, Grealish, Kante, Mahrez, Caicedo, MacAllister, Bissouma etc were before their big moves). They‚Äôre a well oiled machine where everyone seems to be doing their equal share. 

And to add to that, the owneers have fuck off money. Unless it‚Äôs for FFP reasons, they have no reasons to sekl for a price well above market value
Comment: Aston Villa are pretty rich themselves, so I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll feel a need to cash in on any of their guys (which is why most ‚Äúsmaller PL clubs‚Äù sell their best guys). Meaning if they were to sell a player, a club would need to pay over the odds for them or the player to go on strike (unlikely, due to impact on the players $$). 

I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised to hear transfer rumors for guys like Kamara, Ramsey, Diaby, Luiz, and Konsa (maybe). Each have had decent track records of performance level over the years, so teams will be interested in them. Luiz will probably linked to Arsenal, I wish LFC got Kamara before he went to Villa, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a few clubs kicking themselves about Diaby. 

I think Villa is the biggest threat to the big 6. They‚Äôve got a decently rich owner, if they get European competitions every season it‚Äôll improve them, a strong squad, and a manager who‚Äôs been to the biggest European stage and won.
Comment: I would say so - they have owners who have and will continue to massively back them and be able to offer players who perform well good contracts. I would also say that whilst Villa have some great players the manager is also elevating the whole squad up so it's not like a Grealish situation a few years ago where he was the outstanding candidate to be bought and was incredibly difficult to replace - if someone like Luiz goes then I would say they could replace him as they perform well as a team. 

Leicester were unfortunate and unlucky somewhat with missing out on CL closely and then covid hitting their owners probably the worst out of everyone in the league so they then were hamstrung by that. They could've still been there or there about if a few things just went in their favour and covid hadn't happened. 

But clubs are often at the whims of players who may want to go to these big clubs and the money on offer is too big to turn down.
Comment: I mean they clearly have money and if they qualify for Europe the players shouldn't be dying to get out so I think they'll be ok for at least another season
Comment: Aston Villa have super rich owners. They‚Äôre not a bunch of farmers
Comment: The short answer is yes. Our owners have proven to be very wealthy and very ambitious over the past 5-6 years since they arrived.

We have only sold 2 players that we didn't want to leave:

* Jack Grealish for ¬£100 million (we would have lost him for significantly less if he hadn't signed the new contract with this release clause).
* Carney Chukwuemeka for ¬£20 million (a youth player that wasn't ready for our first team in the final year of his contract).

If anyone wants to buy one of our better players they'll have to pay silly money. We might sell 1 big player to allow us more room to improve the rest of the squad within FFP/UEFA rules, but that's about it.
Comment: Do you even know that Aston Villa owner is the fifth riches in the Premier league, behind only Newcastle, manc, Chelsea and arsenal?
Comment: ‚ÄòRoster‚Äô‚Ä¶

The word you are looking for is ‚ÄòSquad‚Äô or ‚ÄòTeam‚Äô.
Comment: >the very recent dip in form notwithstanding

All things considered, less of a 'dip' and more 'winning ugly', which the 'Sky 6' have always been praised for.

(They've been without 4 starters all year. And recently missing Pau, Kamara, Tielemans; injury/suspension)

Villa finished a very clear 2nd in 2023 Calendar table. The team culture seems very strong, and will only sell if 'fuck off' money comes in.
Comment: Villa Fan here. I believe we will keep a good core of these players. This group seems to really enjoy playing for Emery, and believe in the project he is building. Hopefully that faith keeps them around for a bit. 

Watkins is going to be the hardest to hold onto. McGinn a close second.
Comment: Villa are a huge team. Massive. And if they continue this stride, keep Emery, get Champions League football and can offer decent wages, players literally have no reason to go anywhere else. What, are they gonna go to Chelsea or United and lose European footy, or go City and have no minutes, or go Liverpool and be worked to death, or Arsenal and again probably not slot into the squad very well?

Comment: Newcastle fan. I‚Äôm very happy with 6th this season given how bad our injury issues have been, alongside our star signing (Tonali) missing nearly the entire season due to suspension. I think Eddie Howe and the team have handled themselves very well and deserve credit for what they‚Äôve done. I also think that with our squad depth at the moment, I think Europa League is more our level than Champions League. We should never have been in a position to be starting 17 year old Lewis Miley against the likes of PSG, Dortmund and AC Milan - despite him handling it so well!
Comment: Wolves! After all the talent we lost, bringing in a new manager and being under financial scrutiny, if you had told me we‚Äôd be in the middle of the pack, I would‚Äôve said, sign me up! Now if we can just hold on to O‚ÄôNeil‚Ä¶
Comment: I am happy! The way we play, it‚Äôs surprising we ever got to 40 points.
Comment: Spurs fans who aren‚Äôt happy with how this season has gone are just asinine. 

Sold Kane the day before the season starts, tons of good/young signings and currently 5th. You‚Äôve got your keeper and 4 defensive starters lined out for years to come. Before the season started, I would‚Äôve been happy with 7th, a couple fun moments and a thorough plan for additional signings during the summer window. 

Run in to end the season was always going to be tough but I‚Äôm not discouraged by it. Very happy with current outlook.
Comment: As a spurs fan, if I was told at the start of the season we‚Äôd finish 5th/6th with no Kane and a new manager, I‚Äôd have taken that all day long. 
There is disappointment in our performances post the first chelsea game, but overall, can‚Äôt really complain.
Comment: Uhm Chelsea should be happy considering how badly they started
Comment: I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm happy, but I feel a lot better than I did at the end of 2023.
Comment: Wolves fan. 

We‚Äôve had a great season considering the mess we were in after the summer. Not flirted with relegation looked competitive in most matches, scored a ton of goals compared to previous years, and got a few top 6 scalps to add to the collection. 

Now if we could get those VAR decisions right I‚Äôd be absolutely ecstatic chasing a European spot
Comment: Chelsea fan here. Mildly pleased with current position and would be incredible to see us get 6th.

If you told me at the start of the season we would be fighting for 6th, I would‚Äôve been upset, for sure. But given the injuries and squad shuffling, I‚Äôm happy with where we are now.
Comment: Everyone thought that when Kane left, we'd finish outside the top ten and become a mid table team.

New manager who doesn't know the league and we're 5th. There is the occasional sign that you can see what Ange wants from this team too. I'm happy with it, I would have taken it at the beginning of the season
Comment: Heyyyyyy

With our points deduction, squad shuffle, Kenright dying, ownership limbo, and all that bullshit‚Ä¶finishing 15th is pretty good
Comment: if you would have said we were finishing third at the beginning of the year, I'd have been pretty happy

so... kinda us?
Comment: Tbh, with the season we WERE having I have to say normally I wouldn't be happy how it ended.

But seeing it's rebuild year I think it's pretty decent ending (probably) at third place.
Comment: Spurs

At the beginning of the season with Kane leaving, I thought we were going to be midtable. It seems bleak right now but remove the overperformance at the start of the season, I‚Äôm pretty happy for a European spot.
Comment: Liverpool, absolutely. 

Only got Europa League last season.

Got CL this season while also bedding in a whole new midfield and trying out lots of promising youngsters. 

Not bad.
Comment: As a Liverpool fan 100% yes. Coming off last season I was honestly expecting another poor season where we might finish in the top 6 if Villa and others kept improving, which Villa have. To have been in the title race that long was amazing an getting over the last few weeks disappointment its hard not to look back and think its been a very successful season all things considered. Full midfield rebuild including Endo who was lambasted when we bought him after the Caicedo and Lavia farces. Losing Matip for the full season and have Quansah step in so seamlessly, same as Bradley at RB. Winning the Carabao Cup the way we did. All whilst playing under the shadow of Klopps announcement since January/February. Can't complain and excited to see where Slot can take us next season and beyond. Apart from that I think you can maybe add Chelsea to the list with how they have pulled it back over the last weeks/months.
Comment: Newcastle. 

Pretty happy all things considered. Atrocious injury record to a lot of key players (same as other teams I know, I‚Äôm talking about my team, not comparing), and we had a couple of REALLY rough runs of form mid season. We‚Äôve had a slightly dodgy year in some respects but with 2 games left we‚Äôre in the drivers seat to finish 6th, which all things considered is probably about where we‚Äôd have predicted we‚Äôd come at the start. 

Somehow if results go insanely in our favour there‚Äôs a really really outside chance we finish 5th, which is one spot lower than last year, and we‚Äôve missed our keeper, talisman RB and main CBs for long sections of the year and our defence has been honestly disgusting. Crazy really. 

AND we played in the Champions League this year! 

Decent.
Comment: Chelsea. But context is important here.
Comment: I'm delighted with ours, if we're not in Europe at all next season it means there's less opportunities for us to completely embarrass ourselves
Comment: Palace fan.

I can only dream of a season with Eze and Olise together for 30 games or more

Comment: Honestly young generations are going to have some serious gambling problems. Sponsors and ads everywhere and games like fifa acting like an online casino
Comment: I thought gambling firms as the primary sponsor was being phased out (aka barred) in a year?
Comment: Am I slow? I thought they were banning gambling shirt sponsor's?
Comment: What happened to the incoming ban on gambling shirt sponsors?
Comment: Suspend players for gambling....allow betting firms on shirts...mental.
Comment: Sports betting is a cancer
Comment: Betting culture alive and well üôÑ
Comment: Money always wins. You can bet on it ;-) 
But then be banned from playing. 
Hypocrisy manifest
Comment: i love that alcohol sponsors are banned, but gambling? Come on down!!!
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: I thought clubs voted on no gambling sponsors? Did it not pass?
Comment: Even as a Villa fan, gambling sponsors suck.
Comment: 9/1 that the jersey looks shit
Comment: Man City soon to announce they have a shoelace sponsorship deal for  ¬£900 by some obscure never heard of shoelace manufacturing firm from the UAE.
Comment: Boooooooo
Comment: Gambling bad
Comment: With gambling now being understood as an addiction, will teams with those sponsors be forced to cover it up when coming up against a player with an addiction? (Toney/Tonali?)
Comment: Also that‚Äôs a bit of a disingenuous headline. It makes it seem like it‚Äôs a ¬£40 million a season where it‚Äôs ¬£20 million for two seasons.
Comment: The irony of the league banning players for betting offenses, but its teams continue plastering gambling ads all over its merchandise
Comment: I understand why they do this but this will just increase the gap between the haves and the have nots.  Liverpool on ¬£50m a year from Standard Chartered, but majority of the clubs arent getting that.  Often times the only people who want to put their brand and pay a relatively decent amount on a smaller club's kit is a betting company.  How is it fair for some clubs to have airlines and banks but others have to have flamingo land (i'm sure it's very nice but really?)

Comment: Coutinho is a good fit for Villa.
Comment: Coutinho is a phenomenal player, but these stats really don‚Äôt paint the whole picture. Grealish was just an important player to Villa as Coutinho currently is, and that‚Äôs facts.
Comment: 100% Coutinho is the better player. Saying that, Grralish still has years to prove his quality, but my hunch is that he is just a glorified British like Rashford.
Comment: Also, Coutinho is just a better player. Grealish ATTEMPTED to be that guy who raised the play of his teammates game in and game out. Coutinho is already that player when he‚Äôs properly motivated. Just my opinion and the eye test.
Comment: The magician really is at his peak powers when he‚Äôs the best player on his team.
Comment: Really surprised at how bloody good Coutinho actually is. Thought he was way past his peak but he's looked world class every time I've seen him in a Villa shirt.
Comment: On seeing the title I thought this was about Jacob Ramsey. Coutinho is Coutinho
Comment: Honestly I‚Äôd actually say he‚Äôs an upgrade on Grealish, the main reason he‚Äôd struggled at Barca and Bayern is because he wasn‚Äôt the main man at the team, at Villa he will be and they can build around him. 

Grealish still has time and it usually takes a season under pep for players start to perform but as of now Coutinho is definitely an upgrade on Grealish.
Comment: He bossed it in both games against us, reminds me just how good he was before he went to Barca. 

Grealish is still a top player as well. At Villa he was the main man but now he's in a squad full of expensive stars, of course he won't shine as much. Put Coutinho in a team with the likes of De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva and you'll see the same thing.
Comment: And he's better than graelish to boot!
Comment: They didn‚Äôt find a replacement. They found an upgrade.
Comment: Should have never left Liverpool anyway
Comment: I think Grealish is overrated. If he was playing for Ireland instead of England, do you really think he'd get half the hype he has currently and be sold for 100M?
Comment: Wonder why Coutinho's doing so much better in the Prem than in the other leagues. It's like he hasn't missed a beat from his Liverpool days. Technical ability and his cutting in from the left to shoot technique haven't changed a bit. Funny how some leagues suit players so well, even if it's not the league you'd expect them to thrive in the most
Comment: 25m per goal contribution
Comment: this was great business
Comment: How many of Grealish‚Äôs ‚Äòappearances‚Äô has he started?
Comment: This stat only shows that grealish is part of a bigger machine and Coutinho is a big fish in a small pond.
Comment: what a beast
Comment: Yeah, but‚Ä¶ no table for nicest hair?

Comment: 12 months of going under the radar and suddenly we‚Äôre overhyped!

As Emery keep saying, let‚Äôs see where we are by match day 30 or 32, then we‚Äôll know what‚Äôs really possible (and even then we have a tough run in and will have to balance Europe knockouts with the league)
Comment: If Villa wins tonight they will be a point off Arsenal and two points off Liverpool (assuming they win as well). Considering that we are almost halfway through the season, he has a decent point. But I think Emery wouldn't be concerned at all. Reaching the top 4 would be a crazy achievement so I'm sure that he's focusing on that.

It'd be great to see Villa in the UCL considering they were in the Championship not long back.
Comment: We won't win. Don't get our team hyped for just another city win. Just happy with the football we're played.
Comment: Villa fans are not expecting to win this, but there is certainly some hope amongst us.

No better time than the present to break the Villa vs Arsenal losing streak.

Villa play well against teams that are aggressive, so anything can happen.
Comment: Very excited for this game, I hope it‚Äôs a goals-galore thriller honestly. The games this season have been so incredibly entertaining that I think this could be a fantastic match.
Comment: It‚Äôs been cool to see Villa up there so far this season, they‚Äôve been playing some great football, and it‚Äôs also fun to see a new team in the mix that haven‚Äôt been up there in previous years.
Comment: I just want to say, as the average Villa fan, that we won't win the league. Not impossible. But very very unlikely. The average Villa fan will agree with this. Our sights aren't on winning the league anyway, so being up where we are is just an enjoyable ride at the moment 

Just want to put this out there because I've been seeing a lot of "who do Villa fans think they are" type of comments about our recent successes. We know we're poor from home. We know we can't rely on home form to win the league
Comment: High press is a big risk v Arsenal. I think they caught Man City at a particularly bad time, we'll be a stronger test for them.
Comment: You can‚Äôt win a league on home form alone
Comment: Merse is being Merse, that's all. Villa are in good shape and tactically very strong. It's quite possible that they beat Arsenal today if Arteta can't find a way to beat their ridiculously high pressing and defense line. However I doubt they can maintain this kind of form till the end of the season. And their away results aren't that convincing. Emery is a good tactician but he's no premier league title manager. He lacks in man management area.
Comment: Setting up high expectations to knock them back down when they don't reach them. Probably what I hate most about modern football punditry. Shut the fuck up and let them go about their business.
Comment: So Spurs sit top after ten games, unbeaten and Merson says "they're not title contenders".

Villa can go 2nd if they win and Liverpool don't and "they are title contenders".

The usual level of knee jerk consistency by the Sky pundits.

And before the usual Spurs bashing for Spurs bashing sake. Look at the logic being used.
Comment: Be ace if they're still up there at the end of the season. Good to see other teams break up the status quo.
Comment: Villa are not (currently) title contenders, the media are just trying to build their next potential story way too early. If they‚Äôre still there come the end of Feb then let‚Äôs throw them in the mix, but seeing as they‚Äôre still 28/1 and barely favourites to finish 4th, despite being 5pts clear of Spurs, it‚Äôs quite obvious that the current goal should be UCL football.
Comment: If they travelled better then I'd put them in the race. But Villa don't do great on the road. Their away form is the 9th best in the league. If this game was at the Emirates then I'd say its Arsenal's to lose. I'd definitely put Villa in the top 4 race and do believe they'd do it.
Comment: A finish similar to Newcastle last year most likely outcome.
Comment: Not sure about that.  I‚Äôll happily take a Champions League place if it goes down to 5th, I‚Äôd say we are contenders for that!

Though I do win ¬£28,592 if we do win the league.
Comment: I had the great pleasure of watching John McGinn at Hibs for several years.  I  think AV will be very lucky to hang on to him.
Comment: Honestly, if city isn't winning league, I hope it's not Arsenal or Liverpool that do, I hope Villa does it.
Comment: I hope Villa win, I put money on them to get top 4 (And win the handicap table) before the season started and not only would the 3 points be huge but the statement it makes as well.

Comment: If Burnley stay up, Pope will be the reason why. Top class keeper man
Comment: Routine for him tbf
Comment: Fair play to pope he was fantastic last night. Not entirely sure how our xG was only 1.4 or whatever it was because he pulled off some sublime saves to keep it 1-1
Comment: He was brilliant against Spurs too. Son could've led the golden boot race right now if it weren't for him
Comment: I feel that if Pope went to a better team, he'd be back in the conversation as England's best - like Ramsdale at Arsenal
Comment: Love nick pope think the English media haven‚Äôt been very fair to him keep on talking about ramsdale and Pickford forgetting the goat
Comment: Unbelievable keeper. Number one for sweeping clearances in prem too when Burnley play deep... other than playing out the back (he's fine at long kicks) probably one of the best in the league
Comment: He was tremendous last night
Comment: Ramsdale-Pickford-Pope 

English keepers loves some dramatic saves
Comment: Best English shot stopper imo. What a talent. For selfish reasons I hope Burnley lose this wknd, but aside from that it'd be cool to see him stay up with Burnley again
Comment: Leeds going down.
Comment: Fantastic shot stopper, should be England's number one in my (quite biased) opinion.
Comment: He made more than one absolutely amazing save the other night, just look at the match stats and you can see that he easily kept them in the game.
Comment: Pope Nick XVII: The Relegator
Comment: Did you really think Pope wasn‚Äôt the savior ‚õ™Ô∏è
Comment: Wish Ederson was like this. His golden gloves fooled us
Comment: such a great shot stopper
Comment: He may be solely responsible for keeping us up. Praying for results to go our way Sunday.
Comment: It was at this point that I, as a Leeds fan, thought that this was it for us. Then 5 mins later, Weghorst failed to bury a sitter, Mings blocked him on the line pretty much. Now I really don't know what to make of the whole thing!
Comment: Burnley supporters need to have a little ceramic Nick Pope in their nativity next Christmas‚Ä¶

Comment: Chelsea selling their one relentlessly committed and hard working player would be hilarious. 

He‚Äôs the sort of player every club that wants to be successful needs. He‚Äôll never be flashy or the most technically gifted player in the squad but he‚Äôll outwork just about anyone.
Comment: Gallagher would be a class signing for someone like Villa or Spurs. Speaks volumes that no Chelsea fans want to lose him.
Comment: You know you‚Äôre run by idiots when your DoFs want to break up one of the only positions on the pitch you‚Äôre pretty settled. Conor, Caicedo, Enzo and Lavia are really good options and we won‚Äôt be upgrading on that without spending another ridiculous sum of money.

It‚Äôs just absolute nonsense and like many, I‚Äôm hoping Conor rejects any move and walks on a free.
Comment: Villa are really just going to have 47 midfielders
Comment: Gallagher holds all the leverage here, and I personally don't think he'll accept terms with any team ~~and~~ as he desperately wants to stay. 

He knows the owners obviously won't want to/can't afford to lose him on a free, so the likelihood he gets a new contract next season is much higher.

The only way I see him leaving this summer, is if he's spoken to Maresca and been told that he's not in his plans at all - which would be unusual and unlikely
Comment: Yes... Sell arguably your best player behind Palmer. Accounting tricks win trophies!
Comment: I thought he was the fans' favourite at Chelsea?
Comment: Disappointing that, I hate it when big clubs swipe up small clibs' homegrown players
Comment: Absolutely braindead to try and sell him.

It's apparently not even for FFP now as they've done the dodgy loophole deals to sell off club assets and Maatsen looks likely to leave for his 35M release clause. This would purely be to fund even more acquisitions. 

Gallagher's the kind of player it is incredibly beneficial for the club to have, ridiculously committed and hardworking. He's literally been born and bred into the club, which is a rare thing these days. 

While he isn't often the prettiest player on the pitch, he is usually one of the most effective. Great all round player.
Comment: On top of signing Ross Barkley?
Comment: And there are fans who still support this circus of a  board.
Comment: I really enjoyed him at Palace when he was on loan and I'd like to see his scrappy play back, but it won't happen.
Comment: Palace always seemed like a good fit but Villa under Emery might be a brilliant move.
Comment:  Not sure how he‚Äôs an improvement on Villas current team.
Comment: Everyone but us wants to sign him. He‚Äôll just wait until his contract expires then get the $$$ he deserves.
Comment: He is a lovable character that everyone would want in their team. Problem is Chelsea need cash and will over inflate their players prices to make as much profit as possible . I suggest all clubs ignore Chelsea let the players run down their contracts and await their fire sale.  He is great but anything over 30m would be a joke.
Comment: [removed]
Comment: My personal theory is Gallagher will fall off if he moves on from Chelsea. A big factor of what makes him such a good player is how hard he works, and being an academy player and seeing his body language it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs proud to wear the Chelsea badge.

Comment: He was goated at palace

Comment: Premier League refs must surely be the worst in the top 5 leagues in Europe. That's a shocking decision.
Comment: At some point it's going to start to feel like this league isn't legitimate. The officiating is so glaringly inconsistent and it is having a serious impact on results. I know it's just a game, but there's so much money involved in where these teams end up in the table. Champions League & Europa League money, relegation, etc. are all at stake. 

Over the course of a season, officiating that is *this* inconsistent and *this* biased will cost some teams millions of pounds, through little fault of their own. There has to be *some* way to hold these refs accountable, right? 

Aside from fan anger, are really no mechanisms in place that penalize officials for consistent inconsistency? Are there any incentives for refs to get things right?
Comment: How do they manage to watch it back, in slow motion, and still determine that to be foul play by the villa defender?
Comment: Obviously a bad decision does anyone have any idea why they have still gone through with that decision? I am a Man United fan but I can't wrap my head around this.
Comment: that's one of the worst calls I've seen in a while and that's saying something because I watch la Liga regularly too
Comment: Yet again nothing will come of this. Awful referees in the league. Disgraceful.
Comment: Honestly feel like Konsa will be bitter about that one for a while. A stomping and a pk?? Such bullshit.
Comment: This is not a defense at all. There is no way that this play was a foul, let alone a penalty, but what I heard is the only explanation. The people in VAR can only recommend a change if it is clear and obvious based on the on field referee. So maybe they thought there is no way the ref would have been able to see what actually happened. Therefore it was not clear and obvious.  

As I was writing this, all I could think was how stupid it sounds. Premier League VAR is terrible.
Comment: Absolutely heartbreaking, the inconsistency is absolutely killing the league
Comment: Var and the refs should be held accountable and do post game interviews to explain some calls. More time for var to make a decision as well. They shouldn't feel pressure to make quick calls. If we are going in this direction with the game they should be getting the calls right, and we aren't seeing that. Refs should be checking the var video on the sideline too, not just trusting the dumbasses in the var room. Figure it out guys.
Comment: Seriously that was utterly unacceptable.  This is the sort of situation that VAR is for.  Was the ref paid off or something??
Comment: The narrative that refs like Manchester United and give them penalties is stupid. I might get downvoted for that. 

That being said, not a penalty at all. Prem refs are bad
Comment: Just should have had a pen of our own too. Absolutely disgusting from these refs. Just relegate us now.
Comment: The part that drives me absolutely nuts is that the commentary actually pushes the narrative of the calls still being subjective. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the right call but the VAR referee couldn‚Äôt subjectively overturn the call due to an obvious error.‚Äù It‚Äôs black and white, that‚Äôs the point of VAR! It‚Äôs either the right call or the wrong call. There‚Äôs no in between or reasonable doubt.
Comment: the worst part was Gary Nevilles commentary..
Comment: was never not a joke lmao
Comment: Just finished watching MotD. They said that the VAR reffing people admitted that all three dodgy decisions in today's matches were called wrong. Not a good look for VAR when even they admit that they consistently get big calls wrong
Comment: Can I just say as well John Moss is in terrible shape and looked tired 50 minutes in.
Comment: Shocker! I thought it was just me too. Villa, Leicester, Chelsea, Wolves won't be happy with that.
Comment: I think the biggest problem with VAR is that it doesn‚Äôt follow its own law. It‚Äôs supposed to be for ‚Äúclear and obvious‚Äù mistakes. Calls are changed for something minuscule that are far from obvious.

Comment: It clearly and obviously hit his arm and hand about 5 times
Comment: It‚Äôs ironic that ‚Äòclear and obvious‚Äô are subjective terms.
Comment: Clear and obvious error. Ref gave a handball, watching the replays it‚Äôs not obviously an error (as ball appeared to hit arm) so on field decision stayed. Am I missing something?
Comment: The referee disallowed the goal in the first place because he spotted the handball. The Var have confirmed that it hit his hand.


People are talking as if the blame is on var that the goal has been disallowed, when the only way this would have been overturned is if var could prove he didn't hand it. It's not about whether he's the guy that scored, whether he scores with the hand, whether Eddie scores, whatever. Ref gave a handball by Kai, var confirmed it. There is no controversy about this
Comment: Well that‚Äôs a little misleading headline isn‚Äôt it, the initial response was ‚ÄúI prefer not to answer‚Äù, and his ‚Äúclear and obvious‚Äù response was more towards the penalty incident. Even if it correct by the current laws of the game, he probably can‚Äôt admit that he thinks the accidental handball law is wank because PGMOL have it out for him anyway. (As shown by the very reason he was in the stands yesterday)

I personally don‚Äôt agree yesterday‚Äôs one should ever be a penalty but you‚Äôre always going to have people left feeling aggrieved when they are inconsistently given.
Comment: It's clear and obvious that this was not the only chance we created. Expecting for a top 5 strong team like Villa to make meme mistakes that we can cash in on is immature at best.  We created at least 3 more that were certain goals, and we didn't score. People say our finishing was awful. It wasn't. It was non-existent. We take the loss, learn, and move on. It's not even mid season yet and people act like it's game 34.

On the other hand, what he's saying is basically that there's nothing to comment on. I doubt he was happy with our performance either.
Comment: Interviews are really begging him to get another ban/fine with their questioning though. It was ridiculous.

The guy literally asked if he had anything to say about the referees today lol.

If its so bad the for the FA when managers answer questions asked about referees, then the FA should tell interviewers that questions regarding the standard of officiating cannot be asked.
Comment: he actually was asked about 3 decisions.

which 2 were definitely a clear and obvious error.


all that and he still refused to make a comment. classy guy.
Comment: It was clear and obvious he hand balled it himself twice..
Comment: Haha it‚Äôs not a clear and obvious error by the Ref though.. so they wouldn‚Äôt overturn it.. so he agrees? Lol
Comment: Clear and obvious Kai handballed it, yes
Comment: Arsenal loss at Aston Villa, not draw
Comment: I feel like I'm the only Arsenal fan who thought this was the right call.

Of course, I thought the call on the Newcastle goal, while not as clear-cut as this one, was perfectly defensible, too.
Comment: The ball hit his hand like 4 times and he was the last to touch it before it crossed the goal line. This is one of the more straight forward handballs in the box this season, no?
Comment: Well, the referee gave the on field decision for handball. There wasn't a clear and obvious error, so......
Comment: Isn't this about the foul on Jesus? That was a clear and obvious penalty
Comment: Arteta says something: ‚Äúomg he‚Äôs such a cunt he‚Äôs so bitter‚Äù

Arteta says nothing: ‚Äúomg he‚Äôs such a cunt he‚Äôs so bitter.‚Äù

Premier league fans are thick as fuck.
Comment: Misleading title, it‚Äôs also about the foul on Jesus. I‚Äôm biased, but I think it should have been a penalty. As for the handball, it seems it hits Cash‚Äô hand before Havertz. 50/50 call, could go either way.
Comment: The on field decision was no goal. So clear and obvious would have been needed to overturn the decision. There was nothing clear nor obvious. It hit havertz hand but not 100% sure if he‚Äôs the one who bungled it over the line. So with nothing definitive you stick with the refs original decision.
Comment: So hard to listen to Arteta

Comment: Oh wow. Very good squad player. Fair play Villa, fair play Emery
Comment: Top signing by Villa. Emery will get the best out of him
Comment: he is gonna shine with Emery
Comment: Decent grab. A lot of that Leicester squad basically took a year off. In a more motivated squad like Villa have got they could do wonders.
Comment: If anyone can get his work rate up, it‚Äôd probably be Emery

He just needs to stop being lazy off the ball
Comment: good move, provides PL experience and quality depth for both the league and for Europe
Comment: Good buy for Villa. I was hoping we‚Äôd have a look as a Rice replacement but oh well.
Comment: Great move - Villa are going to be a real threat next season
Comment: I had a feeling it would be Aston Villa he‚Äôd end up at
Comment: Hope someone in the Villa team has a strong back to carry him on all season. Laziest player in the prem.
Comment: Lazy player. Need to make sure you have work horses around him.
Comment: Good signing for Emery.
Comment: Great move for all parties tbh
Comment: I was sure Man Utd or Newcastle would go for him; but good grab by Villa
Comment: Hopefully this paves the way for Nakamba to Luton as well.
Comment: Took a step back last season but still very good and could get right back to the form that had multiple top clubs chasing him
Comment: No idea why we weren‚Äôt even entertaining that singing considering our mass exodus of midfielders at the moment.
Comment: Steal of the season!
Comment: Tielemans looked good in the past with quality around him. It has good chance of working out. Plus I felt that the fire had died inside him, maybe Emery can ignite it again.
Comment: Well done to Villa. I was certain he'd wait a bit longer for better teams to come knocking.

Comment: What does ~~Ja Rule~~ Phillipe Coutinho have to say about this?
Comment: He and Eddie Howe were appointed at roughly the same time and a lot of people thought Gerrard was the smarter choice
Comment: Well, the only negative I can see is people will say Lampard is better after this. When they are both crap.
Comment: He's gone now. It is what it is. I always thought he was out of his depth. He should've stayed at Rangers longer or gone to the championship to improve his ability. I wish him the best but he wasn't the one to take Villa forward. 

That being said I felt he was given far too much leeway by the media because of his career as a player. The constant narrative was "we know Stevie, he's a winner, he needs time, he's a man with the right mentality, etc, etc, etc." While that may have been the case with him as a player, I never saw that same quality as a manager and I think most Villa fans would agree.
Comment: I‚Äôm sure his Sky sports pundit mates will say he wasn‚Äôt given enough time (38 PL games & a year to the day almost) but don‚Äôt be fooled‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs been dreadful & can now take his rightful place among them
Comment: Should have stayed longer at rangers another English manager done
Comment: No surprise there let's be honest.
Comment: I said it at the time, this move would ruin his career. 

All he had to do was wait at Rangers til Klopp went but he‚Äôs just the latest person to see their career go to hell because they got sold this idea that Villa is a big club and they‚Äôd be the one to get them back to the top.
Comment: Fuck they should've kept him until we play them
Comment: Wish he had waited until after we played them.
Comment: Poor guy had to get his own Uber home.
Comment: So who's in line to take up the Villa job? I've got no clue so who does everyone else think?
Comment: Gerrard was not a good fit for villa, but you also can‚Äôt polish a turd which is the level of their players at the moment.
Comment: Wonder where Stevie will be going to next......
Comment: And they said he will replace Klopp
Comment: Reading that post last night I wondered, but I didn‚Äôt think it would happen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Comment: Well shit. Now we will get some retread that the fans will shit on too.
Comment: I appreciate how great a player he was^(maybe), but this trend of recent retirees becoming managers, at a top level, with literally 0 experience is fucking ridiculous.
Comment: Honestly a little jealous of Aston Villa supporters right now.

I too would like the current manager of my club to be given the boot.
Comment: Upvote

Comment: They tried to break into the top four in the 00s and ultimately failed. 

I think it'll be tough given I'd put Newcastle ahead of them. They might finish in the top six but they're still quite off breaking into being one of the top six personally.
Comment: This season will be interesting to see how villa do. They're obviously a big club, and they're making moves in the market, but that doesnt automatically equal success.
Comment: I think the top 7 is going to be a closer race than most think.
Comment: We go through this every couple of seasons with a different club. First it was Leicester, then West Ham, now Villa and Newcastle. Spurs have finished in the top 6 12 out of the last 14 seasons and we‚Äôre still talking about them not being part of it. So how on earth does it make sense to question their status after 2 clubs finished in the top 6 once? The level of consistency you have to maintain to be a ‚Äúbig 6‚Äù club is insane. If anything, it may branch into the big 7 or big 8, seeing as it started as the big 4 originally, but even that seems unlikely. Villa were statistically very lucky to finish where they did last season, and have still only finished in the top half like twice this decade. Let‚Äôs all calm down a bit
Comment: There's a big difference in breaking into Top 6 one season vs. maintaining that consistently. 

I do think Villa is on the rise but anything can happen. Football progression is not linear and a lot of clubs strengthened over the Summer. Just have to see how things play out.
Comment: I think people are misunderstanding the meaning of the ‚ÄúBig 6‚Äù. It‚Äôs to do with revenue, not necessarily league position.
Comment: Of the current established big 6 only Spurs have a possibility of falling off. Once they lose Kane they will be in a very critical point.  

Best positioned team to take their place would have to be Newcastle with the new money flowing in. 

Villa can certainly establish themselves as a solid top 10 team who can push into top 6 on any given year.
Comment: I do.
Comment: Gotta break into the big 7 now with Newcastle first
Comment: back in the ‚ÄúLeicester should replace Arsenal‚Äù days i always said that if anyone was to be replaced in the big 6 it would be Spurs out, Villa in and I got laughed at.
Comment: Not without oil money.
Comment: Give it 15 years and then progressively getting better than they might be a traditional big 6/7 team. They have the History and the UCLs to do it. They are also the biggest club in the second biggest city in England. I‚Äôll be downvoted a lot for this take but they are looking very good right now under Emery. If they lose Watkins and can‚Äôt find a decent replacement I might change my mind
Comment: Aston Villa are ‚Äòbigger‚Äô than at least 2 of the ‚ÄòBig 6‚Äô
Comment: I think a lot of people don't realise the "big 6" is essentially down to revenue, and the size of their supporter bases, including the plastics overseas which is what helped City & Chelsea.

Sorry Blues fans, but Villa are the most successful team in the country's second largest city, so they're in a good place to attract fans, they just need enough hype and success overseas to match it and they could quite easily displace a team above them.

Comment: Hope so. Unai Emery is a great coach. Treated like shit imo at Arsenal. Hope they can for him.
Comment: It's all about consistency. Unai Emery is a tough manager to beat and if they keep turning up against the better teams and don't get sloppy against the peons they'll rack up a lot of points. So sure, I reckon they could get up there. They wouldn't be my favourites but them and Brighton are probably the best of the rest.
Comment: No
Comment: Nope
Comment: yes for sure, they have a good manager and have added some quality
