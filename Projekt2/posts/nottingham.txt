Comment: Fuck Gary. 

After the Liverpool game against Spurs when VAR collapsed in a mess, Gary was disgusted with the refs.

The next day, after the refs association were on to Sky, his position changed to defending the refs.

He has been told to defend the referees. Great to see Saha call them out.
Comment: Funny how Neville has been barking constantly for independent regulators for EPL, but God forbid we ask the same for how badly PGMOL have been run. Refs constantly making mistakes week in week out, VAR incompetent to correct their mistakes, refs going off to UAE and Saudi Arabia 1-2 days before EPL games.


Nah got to protect these incompetent mercenaries we call refs
Comment: Naw this ain’t it. Those 3 decisions today were abhorrent at the reason the bloody VAR is supposed to be there is to ensure it never happens. I have no stake in that result but it could be worth millions of dollars and needs to be questioned when it’s obviously foul
Comment: Gary neville is a tool, the man gets paid by sky, why the fuck would he bite the hand that feeds him.
Comment: The same Gary that a few weeks ago on The Overlap point blank suggested teams he'd faced has been doping a cheating is now suddenly against people accusing others of cheating? Cool story bro
Comment: If it happened to United he would be the one penning the letter.
Comment: Yet another commenter scolding a club for being upset that the PGMOL botched calls again. It's been ridiculous the lengths they've gone to protect them this season.
Comment: I hope more clubs follow forest and start giving the pgmol both barels.
Comment: Fuck off Neville you weasel. 

Between the dubious Utd offside call, Forest being done absurdly dirty and Havertz having his ankle cleaved in two this has been one of the worst weekends for the scumbags at the PGMOL.
Comment: What a tit, clearly been told what to say over at Sky, Carra said the same rubbish. 

Embarrassing to say that clubs should never speak out.
Comment: His reaction to the Liverpool statement opened a lot of eyes I think. Was calling the refs out just after the Diaz incident at Spurs and then did a complete 180 as soon as the statement went out. Same as the rest of the Sky pundits. Deep down he knows how dogshit the officiating is in this league but he gets paid by Sky and one of his roles is damage control whenever there's a club looking to take action against the mafia. Zero integrity.
Comment: Gary Neville is all about protecting the institution! He's like the guy at the workplace who puts the company ahead of everything and doesn't realise he's replaceable/just a number.

Didn't I hear Neville openly say on TV few weeks ago how he thought the players in Italy were not clean when he was playing?

The way he holds the Premier League in the highest regard is mind-boggling, especially since we are not exactly free of any corruption in this country.

Look at the way the current Newcastle owners bought them with the help of the Tories. Look at the never-ending corruption and sleaze stories published pretty much on a weekly basis over the last 8 years or so.

If corruption can happen in Italy and Spain, why not in England?

P.s. I personally find it hard or doesn't shout about corrupt everytime my team is hard done by. However, one thing I am certain about is PGMOL should never be judge, jury, and executioner. They are openly ruining the game!
Comment: VAR is the problem , it is being used to back up the referee, not to get the right decision.
Comment: Im not sure what Gaz is on… Coventry were awarded a penalty on the same day for an almost identical handball (maybe even higher up AWB’s arm!). Forest should’ve had a penalty.
Comment: Yet if this happened to Manchester United he would be saying how justified it was and how the officials are a joke, the guys a fucking prick.
Comment: Didn't realise how much of a rant this was until writing it lol. If the people at VAR did their job, what they are paid to do, their actual job then these statements wouldn't be made. 

No other job in the world can allow for week in week out mistakes on this level. If I made this many mistakes when working as a server back at 18 I would've been fired in a few days. 

They are failing at basic level and it's simply not acceptable, add that to the fact you are not allowed to criticise them and it adds to a toxic system with a lack of faith. 

I've no qualms with a few mistakes in a season, shit happens, but to be this consistently awful at, let me reiterate, their job is just not right.

Not backing the tweet here, don't think it's appropriate but I can see where it's coming from if nothing else.
Comment: It’s clear sky and Gary Neville have become unofficial speakers for the PGMOL
Comment: Gary Neville is one of the most cowardly pundits
Comment: Could it have been worded better? Probably. But they genuinely did deserve 3 penalties. Handball is a funny one, since they're always so inconsistent, but they have a pretty good shout and the other two are stonewall in my opinion. 

They just have VAR all wrong, in the quest to avoid 're-referreing' they literally have a system that upholds every decision unless the ref didn't see it at all, the vast majority of the time. They're turning objective decisions into subjective ones and holding their hands up saying they couldn't do anything when everyone involve can see what should have happened. It's worse than having no var at all.
Comment: Sky pundits protecting PGMOL again....gross

Comment: People need to understand that this guy is an actual murderer.
Comment: There are so many ads and tweets embedded into this link that I can’t even find the “footage” that this post is about
Comment: Callum Hudson-Odoi cost Forest that point, not the officials. If he hoofs the ball away from danger and doesn't decide to dribble with it in his own third in the dying seconds of the game, then the whistle is blown and it's a draw.
Comment: Can someone explain why Liverpools goal is supposedly controversial?

Too late? 2 Forest players were booked for time wasting in added time and a little bit of time was wasted when Konate was injured. Its not that unusual for a minute or 2 extra to be added on, especially after time wasting.

The ref stopping play when Forest had the ball? That's literally the rules, Konate had a head injury, they have to stop play.
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: Forest had 2 players booked in injury time for time wasting.

What did they expect?

Regarding the drop ball incident, Tierney done the exact same thing in the first half when LFC had the ball, it was given back to the Forest gk.

Faux outrage does my tits in.
Comment: Forest putting all their frustration at their predicament on a drop ball. Tbh it was arguably a free kick anyway and then the same thing happened when Elliot blasted the ball at the forest player’s head who went down as well.
Comment: Marinakis got confused, thought he is in the Greek superleague and stuff
Comment: He's the Drug Lord of Greece.

...

The guy bursts into fields a few times every year here.

He also bribes,threatens and kills people.

...

Bribes the government,elects mayors,owns channels,sells drugs.

...

He has also entered the Football Committee of Greece and attacked the government officials all on camera.
Comment: Forest played silly games with the time wasting and won silly prizes and got all angry at the ref for following the rules. Way to make yourself and your club look utterly ridiculous.
Comment: Lol they’re unhinged over a drop ball? Did the ref drop it in the Forest goal? I thought maybe they were denied a blatant penalty or something. This is like a linesman awarding a throw in to the wrong team. It may be an error but hardly a cause for this craziness lol.
Comment: It was a blatant foul on Konate, not giving it was the mistake. The ‘outrage’ is laughable.
Comment: King Agamemnon
Comment: I want them relegated so bad lol, going this crazy about a drop ball is so dumb and it's so shit to hire a former ref to try to buy your way in to pgmol good graces
Comment: The time wasting by forest at extra time was comical and it bit forest big time. Take the L. Nothing to see here
Comment: Footage?
Comment: Konate booted in the head, and the ref follows the laws of the game.
Comment: Pretty obvious they are unhinged because of the uncertainty over their premier league future with the poi ts deduction possible while le already being near the bottom and falling quickly. It's like a build up of frustration 😂 not sure if intimidation is the best approach and tactic though . "Bold strategy cotton let's see how it works out "
Comment: They deserve to go down with this clown 🤡
Comment: There’s literally nothing to cry about.

Comment: I see the potential in it but yeah that was terrible
Comment: Worked exactly as planned.
Comment: Im all for unconventional, just needs better execution.
Comment: Tbh that plan probably could've worked. Just the actual kick was rubbish
Comment: It's a copy of the one Huddersfield were using last year. It was really unusual and caught a lot of teams out by causing chaos in the box. Huddersfield scored quite a few from it 

But you can see it's ruined by abysmal delivery; the taker takes an age to hit it, and when he does it's paceless and right at the keeper.
Comment: So, pass it to the keeper.
Comment: Christ it’s like watching a FIFA game
Comment: Lasso special.
Comment: Chaos tactic.
Comment: Lol.
Comment: I can’t believe this clip ends before we get the ironic cheers from the Newcastle fans
Comment: A for effort, F for execution.
Comment: This was hilarious
Comment: Looks like a glitch from  FIFA game
Comment: I like this - it forces the defense to start on the back foot with players running at them, rather than being shoulder-to-shoulder.
Comment: Running straight back to Championship
Comment: I mean you can see the potential for a tactic there
Comment: Needs some work, that!
Comment: One time out of 100 that will work and it’ll be amazing.
Comment: There's a reason why nobody does that, you've given the keeper absolutely nothing to think about other than to come and collect the ball and zero obstacles to evade in doing so. Keeper is probably the tallest player in the box and he can use his hands, he's always going to be heavy heavy favourites to claim it with ease just as he did there. Proper playground routine that.

Comment: Bout time. A club too big to be away from the top table. Congratulations, Forest!
Comment: Happy for them they've been in the championship for like the last 14 seasons. Can't believe a club with 2 UCL's has never been in the premier league in my lifetime.
Comment: I look forward to seeing the MotD animated tree intro.
Comment: I can't describe how excited I am to see Forest vs. City next season. And hear the Forest fans belt out "Champions of Europe, you'll never sing that!"
Comment: We are baaaaaaaaaaack U REDDDSSSSS
Comment: Let's see how you lot compare to r/championship then. But COME ON YOUUUU REDS!
Comment: I’d swap Burnley, Norwich and Watford in the league for Fulham, Bournemouth and Nottingham any day
Comment: Massive club back where they belong, This Prem Season could be even higher quality than the last one
Comment: Arsenal, Spurs, and City know the song coming their way…
Comment: The yanks here won’t understand how significant this is, these guys have won the UCL twice in the past

As a West Ham fan, I know that we are absolutely fucking massive. But I can safety proclaim that Nottingham Forest are a far more massive club, and they’re way more massive than the Spuds, Chelski and Citeh, and arguably Assana too
Comment: I was far more invested in this game than the champions league final. Well done Forest, back from the wilderness.
Comment: Happy for them (Factos)
Comment: Well done Forest … Leeds v Forest is always a great occasion, see you next season.
Comment: Was pulling for Forest so happy with the result.  But fuck me was that penalty call the most  outrageous thing ever.  And to give a yellow makes it even worse!
Comment: Nice to have Forest back, club with history like that should be in the Prem.
Comment: Yank following Forest since '92. Felt like I was the cause of this. Feels good to be back.
Comment: Excited for this upcoming season now!

We thought this season was great, but this will be much better!

All teams looking like they're doing serious business getting good players in

Plus Fulham, Bournemouth and Forest adding into this makes it even more exciting compared to Norwich, Watford and Burnley

Can't wait!
Comment: Good. Another club with proper fans who will show the plastic cunts in this sub why they need to fuck right off.
Comment: Congrats, back where you belong.
Comment: Welcome back, looking forward to the local derby next season! #lcfc

Comment: Good job PL. These cheating bastards deserve to be punished. No place for that in our beautiful game.
Comment: Fucking disgraceful timing. Should have waited to proceed with this at the end of the season and then  dock the points at the start of next season if necessary. 
Meanwhile,  Man City romp home to another league title? Fuck off.
Comment: While I’m all for punishing those who break the rules , this constant back and forth of docking points and then recinding points during the season doesn’t sit well with me. 

Also did the violation of the rules only help forest this season ? , surely you could argue it helped them stay up last year
Comment: Meanwhile man city go on to win another premier league title…
Comment: What about them cheating tramps from Manchester what’s happening with them 
Or are they paying off the  FA as well as
Comment: Apparently they breached the threshold by £34.5m so expect questions from Everton who's breach was less but who got a bigger punishment.
Comment: Now go do Man C
Comment: So as I see it, Forrest and Everton admitted to the breaches because of the evidence provided. Fair enough. But City haven’t and because they’re a scum club ran by a state who never take responsibility for any wrongdoing, are trying to argue against it despite the same amount of evidence being available to those in charge as Forrest and Everton. That means one of two things will happen:

City challenge it and pay off whoever is in charge to totally get away with it.

City will challenge it and lose and be even more punished for it.

I’m hoping for the latter.
Comment: Man City about to be docked into League 2 😂
Comment: Why is this difficult to understand.

Forest and Everton admited fault and accepted the punishment, man city have decided to fight it and thus require a day in court. That's why the charges haven't been enacted upon yet, they haven't admited nor have they been proven guilty. People acting like city aren't getting punished is getting old now. If forest or Everton didn't admit wrongdoing they wouldn't have been docked points yet either.
Comment: Forest, Everton docked. But Nan City rolls along
Comment: Funny how quickly this can be sorted with smaller clubs. Their last two games will be against City and Chelsea!
Comment: Unbelievable, we must punish these cheating scum!
Comment: Now City!!!!! Or have they paid you off ?????
Comment: Now do man city
Comment: And yet man city still receive nothing
Comment: WHERE IS MAN CITY’S SANCTION???
Comment: This is just ridiculous. Everton is docked ten points for £ 30 million breach. Forrest four points for £35 millions . But ManCity has allegedly breached 117 rules but he’s still under investigation (for probably the next twenty years or so). Where is the consistency and the fairness? I am not a jurist so I may be ignorant about these rules. Can somebody help me understand this nonsense?
Comment: But City gets away w/ it
Comment: Everton get 10 then 6 on appeal because of rising interest rates and without a competitive advantage, Forest get 4 after a competitive advantage was gained. Probably 2 or 3 on appeal what a fucking farce.

Comment: I am sure that complaining to the league will get them the exact same thing it gets every team that complains to the league.
Comment: It is a little funny the cheater comes back and in his first game he cheats
Comment: They straight up disallowed a whole goal for no reason and gave Liverpool nothing. You think they care about this?
Comment: Is this the first time you've all watched a game of football? Next you'll be telling me people move up the line a bit for a throw in.
Comment: If a little bit of gamesmanship like this can never happen because we decide to review absolutely everything, we truly will have killed the game. Toney cons the ref, who is distracted, but it also takes the Forest players not paying attention for this to happen. No one raised the alarm, VAR didn't believe there was anything to check, play resumes from kickoff and it's over.
Comment: I can't believe the player in the wall didn't do anything. If this was Sunday league I would be screaming at the ref and then running up to the ball to stop the take so we could rearrange the wall. The Forrest players just watched it happen!
Comment: PGMOL says it’s the ref’s (and sideline officials’) responsibility to keep an eye on everything. Ref turned his back on the ball, sideline officials didn’t see or speak up about it, opposing players didn’t raise any concerns. Goal counts.

If Liverpool aren’t going to get anything out of PGMOL directly admitting they erroneously ruled a good goal offside after a bungled VAR check, Forest will certainly get nothing out of this.
Comment: Be funny if they banned him.
Comment: This whole "it's Forrest's players fault for not noticing" is such a weird take. You're basically saying that the ref doesn't have a job without players telling him what to do. If there is a foul they should surround the referee or it's their fault it didn't get called. Sure they players can call attention to it but it's the refs job, not the players, and the players have other this to worry about. 

With that being said, I hope Nuno appreciates the apology letter, because at this point that's all they're getting
Comment: Hope they're asking how to focus on their jobs and how to make an effective wall
Comment: I hope pgmol have the balls to reply with your right he did move it but we can’t help but notice your wall is also infront of the line so as you were
Comment: It's not part of the VAR remit, so nothing will come from this. The problem in VAR dealing with this, is that if attacking free kicks are covered, then logic dictates so should all free kicks, direct and indirect as well as throw-ins, where ground is gained. I suspect that's why it can't review it as it opens a can of worms.

Can just imagine the uproar if a quick throw-in or an IDFK from an offside results in a goal, but because some ground was gained, it has to be ruled out.
Comment: I dont agree with Toneys action but i can vibe with it you know. A man got to do what a man got to do. 

Also its no higher “cheats” then Rodri 10th tactical foul to stop a counter attack, or a deliberate shirt push pulling by everyone during all corners (that impacted the outcomes too you know), all the nasty tackles, the extra 10 yards for throw in, and whatever else thats ongoing on the pitch for your team to have an extra edge. Heck Stoke team used to towel-clean the football before each throw ins how is that not “cheating”? People over water pitches. People stepping into the penalty spots. All kind of shit just to have an edge. 

Compared to all those things Toney just move the ball a bit but still need to hit the target, around a wall, with a keeper on the line.

Yeah im with Toney on this one.
Comment: Dear Mr PGMOL,
Ivan Toney is a cheating scoundrel and should be banned for another 8 months.
Yours sincerely 
Nottingham Forest.

What happens if the letter gets lost in the post? Load of bollocks. Move on, Forest, he done ye.
Comment: Nothing will come of this.  This isn't in the VAR protocol and has to be caught on field.  It's only being called out cause they scored a goal, but no one ever takes the free kick at exactly the spot the ref says to, or at exactly where the foul occurred.
Comment: I mean yeah they should. It's a blatant breach of the rules and should've been caught by the referee
Comment: Dumb complaint. Watch a game of football and botice how many times a player takes a throw in from a different position or a free kick. It was a good free kick. If toney had moved the pall 5 yards it's a different story but this isn't much
Comment: I mean, yeah he isn't not allowed to move the foam, but var cant intervene on restarts and the wall and keeper have to be more aware In case the ref doesn't see it. I'm not sure what they are expecting the outcome to be from complaining.
Comment: Everyone is acting like this hasn't happened before. I dont understand why a fuss is being made now

Tbh I'm completely fine with VAR not getting involved in this stuff

I can remember [Fabregas](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/muDOallraw8) doing it for Chelsea off the top of my head. I think maybe [Luiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35fmQ9LlR0k&pp=ygUjZm9vdGJhbGwgcGxheWVyIG1vdmVzIHJlZmVyZWUgc3ByYXk%3D) as well but I dont remember what club he was playing for at the time

EDIT: found links
Comment: There is no way to reverse what happened but Toney should get a long (10+ games) suspension for extremely unsportsmanlike conduct. 

They are looking for handballs under a microscope yet you can run away with shameful clear cheating. Awful enforcement of sporting regulations

Comment: Cheating bastards deserve it
Comment: They should just refuse to disclose the financials and not cooperate.
Seems to works for 115FC
Comment: Surely we can just sell a few buildings to ourselves?

I mean, that's the Chelsea way, or is that route reserved for the top six?

Perhaps that will become permissable only after the bigger clubs have plundered the 2-3 players they want for us for a cut price?
Comment: Perfect example of how the justice system works. The local party house gets busted time and again with ruthless precision to keep all the poors in line yet the billionaire's party yacht stuffed with cocaine and hookers that makes headlines every week gets litigated to death.
Comment: Said it before and I’ll say it again. FFP is nonsense, absolute nonsense. I will be making no further comment. Until I do. Again.
Comment: Wouldn’t bother. Having a good team is worth more than a six points deduction.
Comment: Ipswich looking at the squad list like it's black Friday.
Comment: Yet 115 FC walks free again.
Comment: Hack is to dial up more than 100 cases.
Comment: They are better off taking points deduction if they are happy with the squad not really sure what that tells you about the league
Comment: For me, this highlights the fact that FFP is designed to help the relegated premier league teams bounce straight back and severely punishes any team that hasn't been in the Prem for a good few years. The lower cap on championship seasons means that if a club does somehow manage a miracle and get promoted after years outside the top flight (e.g. Forest, Luton, and Ipswich, next year) then they are handicapped on spending for this achievement. "You can have one season, lads, but don't go spending all your pocket money." We all saw how badly the three promoted sides did this year, and I expect the same next season. Leeds, if they get promoted, may do okay as I think that they loaned out a lot of key players last season in the hope to have them back next season in the Prem, but Leicester and Ipswich will struggle I think. It would be much fairer if promoted sides were given an additional spend allowance for getting promoted, maybe in line with the spend allowed for a premier league side for that season, but unless something like this happens then promoted sides will either "cheat" by going over FFP or go straight back down. One or two may get extremely lucky, but in the main, the promoted sides will be the relegated sides for years.
Comment: Honestly let's just keep our players and take the points deduction. Murillo and MGW are worth more than 4-6pts
Comment: Forced to sell to established clubs who have the revenue stream to buy and sustain players.

While those wanting to compete can't because they spend too much money.

Wheres the fair play?
Comment: If they don’t, swap them for luton
Comment: Meanwhile city with 115
Comment: Yet oil city 115 fc get a parade.
Comment: As easy as it is to shit at FFP, their transfer deals were insane in 2 years. 

They had their 7 most expensive transfers and 19 of their top 20, some already being moved on at a loss, others that barely play, over €200mi net spend in just those 2 seasons.
Comment: Forest have signed I think 63 players in the last 2 windows? At some point you'd hope they start thinking long term. Why are they signing 3 goalkeepers in 1 window? 

Some level of sympathy but Forest are in this mess because of Forest. Particularly when you consider other clubs are trying at least to play within the rules, while Forests owner appears to want to play high stakes poker.
Comment: Fuck you premier league
Comment: This was foreseeable, they have a net spend of just over £200m from the past 2 seasons and have spent just over £140m on player wages in that same time period. For a club that had spent over 20 years out of the first tier of English football that is far too much. They probably took a calculated risk with points deductions, which is why they were so quick to cooperate and not exacerbate the situation. Staying up is worth a lot of money, they'll be awarded £118.6m for 23/24 by the PL, which if they were relegated would be held in escrow and drip fed to them as part of the parachute program.

Comment: Let’s clear this up. The goal was a result of Forest not clearing corner and trying to pass out from box . Nothing to do with a drop ball 2 minutes earlier
Comment: The way everyone is banging on about this you'd think Liverpool got a dodgy last minute penalty or something. This is the equivalent of losing your mind because a corner or throw in goes the wrong way.  
  
There was 2 corners and throw in after this decision, 1 minute 50 seconds before the goal was scored. Forest had multiple bookings for time wasting in extra time, multiple chances to clear the ball before the goal and most importantly multiple attempts to score themselves and win the game.  
  
The refs this year have been a disgrace but to think Liverpool have somehow been gifted a game they didn't deserve by a poor ref decision is ludicrous.
Comment: As someone who does not want Liverpool to win the league, the stupidity that Forest players tried to do in their own penalty box that led to the goal is the most appalling thing and their lack of game awareness should be instead talked about more....
Comment: https://imgur.com/gallery/SfUMFhY

Should have been a free kick to Liverpool and a red card to Yates, he came flying in kung fu style with studs up at head height and could have taken someones head off, straight red card in the rules of the game.

The exact same drop ball issue went in the same way at the other end of the pitch earlier in the game, the difference between the two incidents is this one should have been a Liverpool free kick anyway.

Forest and Yates got away with one big time and are now bitching about a non-issue. You didn't clear your lines and you lost because of it, stop crying.
Comment: Yeah, should have been a free kick to Liverpool because Konate got karate kicked in the head.
Comment: Why are people ignoring the fact that exactly the same thing happened to Liverpool earlier in the half?

Elliott had possession in their half after an attack had been cleared. A Forest player was down in the area, Eliott pointed the referee to it, and he stopped the game. After the player got up, the game was restarted with a goal kick to Forest!
Comment: Hope everyone gets over it like we were told to get over losing a goal to VAR.
Comment: Two things are true about this incident:

1) Paul Tierney is a shit ref that doesn't know the rules.

2) The actual impact of his error in this case is somewhere between "throw in given the wrong way" and "goal kick awarded when it should have been a corner." Incidentally, these are both things that happen multiple times in every match.
Comment: Genuinely cannot understand why this is being talked about so much 

In-between the contentious drop ball and the goal, the ball went out of play twice and Forest won back possession twice, it's not like the decision directly led to Liverpool's goal, at this point how far back do you want to go to find something to feel hard done by
Comment: The reaction to this is monumentally stupid. Its no more egregious an error than giving a free kick mistakenly etc and that happens all the time, I have to imagine it's blowing up because Clattenburg is at Forest and is stoking the fire.
Comment: I don’t really get this - if a linesman incorrectly awarded a throw to the wrong team and 2 minutes later they scored then it is what it is. It’s such a minor decision in a game - it’s still Forest’s responsibility to defend which they didn’t do. 

This is absolutely nothing. Football is getting to the realms where everything has to be perfect. Does anyone want VAR to be used to assess whether it really was a team’s throw in 3 minutes earlier after they score just in case the linesman got it wrong?
Comment: This again...


What ever  Shearer...

Both team have got it wrong from many occasions in the game. Liverpool took their chance, Forest dont...


Liverpool win.. stop. Next game.
Comment: Did Alan Shearer also blast the totally wrong drop-ball decision for Forest earlier in the game? 

Nah, didn't think so.
Comment: Maybe my standards for reffing have dropped in the last few years but my reaction is basically it’s not that bad, refs make minor errors most games, no football team plays a game expecting the ref to give them everything they deserve you have to play well enough to overcome these things.
Comment: Wasnt it actually a foul on Konate?
Comment: Lol people making it look like NF didnt recover possession again before our goal, wild
Comment: Is shearer biased as fuck. Hell yes. 

Is shearer right in this situation. Mostly yes. 
Comment: After all the ridiculous calls we have seen thus far in the prem the only reason this is getting way too much attention is because its Liverpool. As a whole can we all agree that reffing needs to drastically improve. So many heinous errors have been made against many teams throughout this season.
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: Why is this getting so much attention?
If Forest got the drop ball and managed to score, their goal would 100% be chalked off by VAR for the high boot on Konate. Whether the Forest player made contact or not, it's a reckless and dangerous play because a few inches anywhere else and Konate would've lost some teeth or an eye. 

As for the Liverpool goal, way too much time passed in between to say Liverpool took advantage of the drop ball. The teams exchanged possession more than twice and Forest lost the ball fair and square to get the pass to Darwin in

Comment: No room for cheaters in this league. Ruining the beautiful game!
Comment: Meanwhile City is sending cease and desist to YouTubers for mentioning the 115 charges... City need to have points deducted last year already yet, give Arsenal the league
Comment: We told the EPL that the officials on the appeal board were all Luton fans.

- Nottingham Forest, probably.
Comment: City with 115 charges tho💀
Comment: You are not city to get away with everything
Comment: Probably because it makes the relegation battle more exciting.
Comment: It’s almost as if sending out petulant tweets two weeks ago accusing Premier League refs of being corrupt was incredibly stupid and counter-productive.
Comment: similar to an appeal on reddit
Comment: Who do they think they are? Manchester City?
Daring to even appeal.
Comment: City buying the league is way worse for the league than United being a mess.  One opens the door for competition, the other shuts it.  Pretty obvious which is better long term for the league.  Also, City haven’t surpassed United in the PL era on trophies, domestic or European, suspect to say they’re better than United. 

Also, City voting against, then lying and cheating to avoid, FFP restrictions should be taken seriously.  No club is above the rules.
Comment: They will probably survive anyways
Comment: In the meantime 115club chilling at hottub
Comment: I still think they’re safe imo
Comment: Starting the point deductions with Everton and Forest is not a good look for the Premier League.
Comment: Can someone explain how the most egregious overspenders and outside financiers man city have gotten away without a points deduction this season? 

Sort of feels like we allowed a lot of these clubs to acquire tons of assets from outside money and then one day suddenly said: okay that’s illegal now, but we’re going to base it off of current status, so despite your gains being ill-gotten by todays standards, you’re grandfathered in so now youre part of the country club and we’re closing the doors to the riff-raff now. 

I work in anti-money laundering and this feels to me like the PL suddenly washed all this dirty money for certain clubs.

Just feels very unfair and subjective the way they are handing out these point deductions, especially when many of these clubs aren’t even benefitting from their spending.

Edit: I get that the books are cooked, but while these charges are pending, they shouldn’t allow any of their achievements to be finalized, it should be pending and any acknowledgment or official celebration by the club should be penalized and punished. Retroactive punishment does not take away their achievements and the advantages said achievements allowed them to obtain, and you can’t throw parades for Liverpool retroactively.

Comment: The irony that them appealing did not add more points after getting less for cooperation damm I miss this game called football prem has become a soccer league now
Comment: They got off lightly and probably should have had the two points they got removed for cooperating added back on

Comment: double it

Comment: 2 minutes and 3 phases of play before we scored the goal, what utter bollocks and if people are seriously comparing this to a legitimate goal being wrongfully called offside then they need their brains examined.
Comment: When the Forest player took a ball to the head and the game was stopped, Liverpool had possession.

The ref then gave the drop ball to Forest.

At least he was consistent.
Comment: Clattenburg isn't exactly impartial in this, he's employed by Forest
Comment: Forest got the ball back twice between the incident and the goal
Comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/s/exfcb1aat7

Konate was booted in the head, rightfully lfc ball
Comment: Jesus Christ... Everyone is acting like Tierney called for a drop ball and then walked to the other side of the field and dropped the fucking ball into Nottingham's goal for the win by himself.

If Nottingham knew how to kill a game off, this wouldn't be a problem... Just like last week.
Comment: Konate got kicked in the face from a egregious high boot during that play. No booking or anything. Should’ve been a free kick to LFC so I don’t see what the controversy is.
Comment: Wasn’t Konate booted in the head?
Comment: Referee error? I am losing my head with all the response to this win.
Comment: On MOTD they just say Konate was injured by Kelleher. Three replays that don’t show the contact and no mention of the flying boot. I honestly don’t know what happened based on those replays, but as I was watching I couldn’t see how Konate got a head injury from Kelleher’s contact.
Comment: Terrible decision. It was a blatant foul on Konate, and dangerous play with the bit at head height, yet he didn’t give it. The rest is all irrelevant.
Comment: Everyone moaning seems to be totally missing the rules.

Drop ball is for the defending team when the incident occurs with the ball in the box, or last touched in the box.

The fact that the ball continued to be played doesn't change that the whistle to stop play refers back to the incident that occurred and the state of play at that time - as it always does.

Just because the whistle happened 5 seconds later doesn't make that passage of play valid. If the flag for offside goes up but the ball goes in the net before the whistle, is it a valid goal? Of course not - the whistle stopping play brings play back to the moment of what it refers to.

Same and opposite happened a few minutes before, also correct.

If we're discussing bad decisions then konate getting a forest boot to the head should have been a foul/yellow/red take your pick. Forest fans want to ignore the egregious high boot while splitting hairs over correct drop ball possession. You can't have it both ways, even if the ref was wrong.
Comment: These headlines should include the fact that Clattenburg is employed by forest to speak out, he’s not doing it out of the kindness of his heart.
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: Where is the controversy? That mistake happened in the 96th min and the goal was scored in the 98th, Forest had a whole 2 mins to defend and clear the ball.
Comment: The only reason that game was still being played when Kounate went down is because their keeper decided to waste time and stay down for 5+plus minuted because an 18 year old jumped into him. If he just got up and carried on there wouldn't have been 8 minutes of extra time and Forest would have got a point.
Comment: Looked like a red card for the head kick to konate ttbh
Comment: Nobody in the media actually talking about the high challenge on Konate.
Comment: He gave the ball away and forest win it back. At that point the controversy ends. Some time later Liv score
Comment: Marinakis the President of Nottingham last year accused Clatt of being bribed while leading the Greek Football Committee and now hires him!

Comment: As a supporter of a honest mid table club it makes me sick knowing there’s clubs out there cheating.
Comment: Any news on when they'll eventually get around to city and Chelsea or do they just get a free pass? The Premier League is so blatantly corrupt it's unbelievable.
Comment: How are City meant to compete in a league with so many cheaters abound? Truly an incredible underdog story.
Comment: What I don’t understand is that apparently the City case will be investigated and finalised in over a year because there are too many cases and it takes time, but for Everton they have done two already, so why can’t they do City’s individually as well?
Maybe I misunderstood the whole thing, but it feels really weird.
Comment: City fans: “punish teams who are found to be cheating”
Also City fans: “comes up with 115 reasons City haven’t done anything wrong”
Comment: Man city when ?
Comment: Man City just wander past whistling. 😗
Comment: Thank god they got Everton and Nottingham Forest, they had this league under a choke hold with all the cheating, luckily teams like Chelsea and City have a chance now.
Comment: Anyone but city seem to get found guilty
Comment: Taking into account that city won the league twice by a single point, anything but stripping them of silverware would be injust, and for me throw the whole integrity of the sport into dissaray. Thus provoking me to believe that perhaps a super league or any other type of competition would be the correct answer, and let the teams govern themselves
Comment: So they have time to charge Everton twice & now Nottingham Forest BUT oddly they don’t have the resources to push forward the case against Man City. It just makes the entire FFP system & FA look as dumb as we all know it is … corrupt as F & serving the needs of wealthy clubs 

When will FFP actually have any positive impact on football? -> each year record transfers per season & record agent fees … players on silly wages etc 

Multiple clubs on the brink of financial crisis but on it goes …. Chelsea 1 billion spent 

At some stage when will the corruption be exposed? It’s like some 1950’s mafia syndicate … or some narcotics cartel
Comment: Can’t wait for city’s 1150 point deduction, removal of each trophy and relegation to non league. Football will stabilize again and the cheaters will be punished correctly.
Comment: If the rules only penalise up and coming clubs, and doesn't restrain Man City or  Chelsea, then the rules aren't fit for purpose. 

If you charge everton twice but chelsea can spend a billion then wtf. Just ban teams from getting better if thats what you want to do.
Comment: City fans will brigade all they want but they’re coming for you next. Plastic artificial club
Comment: The whole league is in a mess. The elephant in the room just keeps looming larger and larger 

🐘 115
Comment: Seriously,  and nothing for Chelsea or City?
Comment: Multiple new charges for small clubs and City still adding to the success gained from over 100 breaches?
Comment: The premier league are proper fucking dumbledores "Ten points from evertoooon"
Comment: Meanwhile, at Manchester, nothing ever happens.


It's nice to have oil.
Comment: I mean is anyone surprised? Forest signed like 25 players in a 12 months span.

Everton have also been run incredibly poorly. 

In forest’s case it appears the “accounting deadline” makes things seem worse than they are as they had big sales literally the month after so they’re hoping a broader look at the finances will show their compliance. Not sure about Everton though.

Comment: Let’s start using VAR to decide exact throw in positions every time the ball goes out of play
Comment: Isn’t it funny how they’re complaining about a free kick not being taken where play was stopped for the foul. Baring in mind none of their players complained to the referee. 

But never mind all the times players from every team steal about 20 yards from a throw-in and not restarting play where play is stopped. IMO it’s no different. As long as the referee is happy where it is. Then play is restarted.
Comment: I find it sad that I feel like I'm in the minority for thinking this is clear cheating and should not be rewarded. Its hardly surprising though, in the world we live in grifters get ahead.
Comment: Now listen, I'm Gary Neville and I've decided that any club that officially complains to PGMOL is an EMBARRASSMENT. It's EMBARRASSING that you care about your club, and about obviously wrong decisions that are made against you. Liverpool complaining about a completely onside goal being disallowed for offside, in a game that could effect the title? EMBARRASSING. Forrest complaining about a player choosing to take a free kick away from the assigned spot, in a result that could effect relegation? EMBARRASSING. 

If you complain about things, you are embarrassing, humiliating, disgusting, and a bit smelly tbh. 

Yours Sincerely,

G Nev
Comment: PGMOL actually need to do something here.

Because moving the ball wherever you like becomes 100% fair game and established practice on Monday if they just tell us to sod off yet again and say nothing.

Watch Toney- speaks to their number 8 (I think Jensen) who then goes over to distract the ref. We can guess exactly what Toney told him to do. He then moves it. Twice. And the foam.

What Toney does there becomes the rule, so long as the refs don't catch you, for all clubs from this week if they just ignore this. 

It's cheating.

Doesn't matter how shit our defending is. We are shocking at set pieces. But that was cheating and it has wider implications for the PL, including the clubs of all these idiots laughing at it as if it's ok.

And what pisses me off the most is that kids see that, they see the commentators praising it and then it becomes the right thing for them to be doing for their school teams
Comment: Forest were fucking dopey, but if this is all fine, then why bother with the ref spraying the foam at all?
Comment: I wonder how many more free kicks would be scored if players were allowed to move the ball a yard to the side after a wall is set.
Comment: It’s like the man said himself. It happens all the time, and if it didn’t go in, nobody would even be talking about it. 

It’s similar to when defence sets up their wall a foot too close, most of the time refs don’t sweat it, unless you’re taking the piss. 

Nobody said a thing until after the match. Even the commentators didn’t say anything.

Even if NF players didn’t complain to ref (which would’ve been the easiest thing to do) they could’ve moved their positioning if they thought it would’ve made a difference.

If PGMOL want to stamp it out they will have the video referee watch out for it in future. Doubt anything will be done on this occasion.
Comment: However this request arrived to PGMOL, it was immediately put in some form of bin.
Comment: PGMOL reply 

Dear forest, 

Move your wall slightly to the left and you would not have conceded 

Many thanks 

Also, every fucking player moves the ball on free kicks and offsides (goalies move it five-ten yards sometimes). Every player gains yards at throw in.
Comment: Cheat returns after eight month ban and continues cheating. Shocked! Shocked, I tell you!
Comment: It's a weird one. Referee is distracted and not looking as Toney adjusts the ball and even redraws the line, but the Forest players are also not paying enough attention. I think VAR should have intervened, Toney con's the ref, and the wall is set up based on where the ball was initially positioned by the ref. VAR likely missed it because no one raised the alarm, there didn't look to be anything to check and by the time play restarts it's too late.

It'll go down as a great bit of gamesmanship from Toney which helped earn Brentford all 3 points,
Comment: Oh give it a rest. Players foul throw every game. Players put the ball over the line when taking corners. The wall moves over the foam line everytime. Everyone does it and everyone at this level will always cheat where they can. Toney is a cunt but this is not a Toney only thing.
Comment: It’s a restart so not under VAR and moving the spray and ball is a booking office only so again, not covered by var.
Comment: I have seen more competent officiating in professional wrestling...
Comment: I don’t understand why everyone is blaming Forest. Toney blatantly cheated and if VAR isn’t picking up things like this, genuinely scrap it.
Comment: It’s actually so dumb. There’s clear camera footage of it but why don’t VAR intervene at the time? He could’ve just been made to move it back. In rugby the TMO assists the referee and intervenes when necessary. Same with Kluivert’s tackle earlier just inconsistency and general stupidity.
Comment: Will the letter make reference to the Forest wall standing ahead of where it should have been?
Comment: Yet no one talks about the wall being over the line.
Comment: Lmao the butt hurtness over moving the ball is unreal. Literally everyone has moves the ball before a freekick. Why is this any different?

Comment: I really hope they can build on it and become a mainstay in this league, a great credit to the club also for not flinching and staying with Steve Cooper
Comment: We’ve all been awful but kudos to Forest for holding onto Coopet instead of panic breaking the “Sack the Manager” glass. Continuity really is the most important thing.
Comment: Step one : survive 

Step two: ????

Step three: Champions League 

Step four: go through the arduous process of changing our logos with three stars instead of two
Comment: Arsenal fans who don’t know, should:

> In 1895, two years before the Club became professional, a small group of Nottingham Forest players, Fred Beardsley, Bill Parr and Charlie Bates, joined Dial Square FC, (the Club’s first name) and brought their old red kit along with them.

>Working to a tight budget, the Club decided the most inexpensive way of acquiring a strip was to kit out the team in the same colour as the ex-Forest players.

>This original kit was a dark red, with long sleeves, a collar and three buttons down the front. The shirt was worn with white knee length shorts and heavy woollen socks with blue and white hoops. The goalkeeper wore the same attire apart from the shirt - which was a hand knitted cream woollen polo neck jumper. It was this dark red kit that the team wore during their first season at Highbury in 1913/14.

Shrouded in Red since 1895, we owe part of our history to them.

Today may hurt, but please take pride in the season both of these historic teams have had, and make sure to congratulate any NF fans you know.
Comment: I can see Forest really coming into next season. They were riddled with injuries and deserved to stay up.
Comment: Really hope forest stay in the league again. A truly historic club that’s had to endure some tough struggles, but a ton of credit to Cooper and the team
Comment: While obviously I'd love to have seen Forest at least somewhat near the drop for the last day of the season (anything that improves our chances of survival); the football fan in me is pleased they've stayed up - mainly because earlier in the season when it looked like Cooper was a DMW the club kept faith with him, and they have been rewarded for it.
Comment: All 3 newly promoted teams stay up. Wow.
Comment: Chelsea need to give you lot a call, ask for a tutorial on how to sign a million players at once and still manage to build a cohesive team out of them. Really well done by the club.
Comment: As an arsenal fan I am very happy to see forest stay up, class club who deserve to stay in the league. Would love to see where they go from here
Comment: I am a brand new fan, never followed any team before. I chose Nottingham based on the name and the fact they they were just promoted. Watching them all season has been so amazing and thrilling, and I'm glad I picked them. They all look like good guys, and today's win was so satisfying. I'm a fan for the rest of my life!
Comment: Much as it sucked seeing Arsenal lose to Forest today, very cool to have all 3 newly promoted teams stay up.  I typically root for at least 2 of the 3, but hey 3/3 is sweet too!
Comment: The stadium today was absolutely electric and it radiated out of my tv. Props to the fans
Comment: I want Leeds to go down. They should have went down last season. The reaper of back for them
Comment: I’m happy for you. Hopefully Everton joins us.
Comment: Loved watching NFO this season!  Glad they stay!  Hopefully they can build on what they did!  Also loved that they had no jersey sponsor for a long time.  Almost bought one solely because there was no sponsor!
Comment: Round of applause from an arsenal fan 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Comment: That's correct.

But Forest will stay in the league because even though Forest is bad, Leeds&Everton&Leicester&Southampton are very bad to awful depending on your rating system. The quality of relegation teams are not good compared to previous years.

If Forest doesn't improve next year, it may cause a problem. Burnley(a yo-yo), Sheffield United(a yo-yo) and Luton/Coventry winner are coming. They build a decent squad and suddenly Forest is in the danger zone.

But, that's June to August's topic.

Congrats to Forest's fans, nice addition to the Premier League.
Comment: It was a good season, with that amount of injuries I think Forest did it great. I still remember when they won the promotion vs Huddersfield and look them now, another season in the Premier League.
Comment: Delighted for them. One of my earlies memories is watching them conquer Europe. I've had memories since that weren't as happy, but that's football.

Comment: Unpopular opinion I say fuck it 

Hit them with everything you can, show them your srs about this bullshit with the PGMOL 

The pundits desperately stepping over clubs and fans to defend the clearly crap and broken refereeing is just a huge disgrace.
Comment: Everyone hates the PL as an organisation, Sky sports, Gary Neville and the Refs but when a club goes after them they’re being a baby.
Comment: Football fans: we hate VAR and sky. 

A club goes after VAR and Sky

Football fans: omg what babies! Why can’t they just accept it like everyone else? 

Fucking bunch of boot lickers in here.
Comment: Good. 

Fuck Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher the two leading causes of turning matches on 5 mins beforehand and off straight after.
Comment: I don't care who's in the wrong I fucking hate sky for ruining football. I'm glad that everyone I know has a hacked fire stick and I fucking hope they lose millions! 

Tnt and sky can fuck off and die!

Zero personality as well, if you ever see Carra and TiTi and Micha on CBS champions league coverage that's how it should be!

I dread half time and post match because of how fucking sterile it is!

I'll defend a football club and it's fans every time over Warner fucking brothers and Comcast!
Comment: Good on you forest. I can't believe how many fans complain about VAR and take objection when they see a club acting like a fan. 

Anyone suing Neville gets my support. I like how you go wild af, forest do you and good luck. If I wanted a club to be responsible and dull I would follow politics.
Comment: Karenham Forest
Comment: Probably not gonna lead to anything,  but I'm definitely always gonna be on the side of "we need way better reffing" lol
Comment: Neville is garbage.that is All
Comment: Not gonna lie, hes a shit commentator, both him and carragher should fucking do one.
Comment: I am not sure FA will like the idea of another mafia raising to power.
Comment: What's the slur? Mafia?
Comment: FA and Sky Sports starting to realise exactly who Evangelos Marinakis actually is.  

How he passed the Football League ‘Responsible Person’ Checks beggars anyone’s belief.
Comment: “Slur” 

LOL
Comment: A good number of people here have absolutely no idea what Neville said or what he said it about it would seem
Comment: Neville’s has his day now. Still waiting for him to ‘HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUES’ in Qatar.

When it came to it he said that ‘train drivers had to strike to get more money in England so we shouldn’t point fingers’

Comparing that to migrant workers dieing left right and centre to build the stadiums while being paid pennies.

Absolute Narcisisst who will do and say whatever suits him best
Comment: "Slur" is a hilarious way to describe that comment.
Comment: Of all the seasons to get a points deduction this is the season to have it
Comment: Full Support
Comment: One of the most embarrassing seasons for a club we’ve ever seen.

Comment: Considering they lost most of their squad they had to spend.
Comment: From what I understand they had 5 loans last season so had to spend. They have given themselves every opportunity to stay up. It's a lot of money if it backfires though.
Comment: Probably, yeah.

Being in the PL is worth a tonne of money, if they stay up it definitely would've been worth it. Even if they don't stay up with the squad they've now got and the parachute payments they have a strong chance of coming back up quickly too. 

The only way it's not worth it is if they get relegated this year and aren't back in the PL by 2025.
Comment: Are all these totals including add ons? Spurs is about £30m over on flat fees! Not that it matters in the grand scheme of things.

As for Forest, a load of their squad was on loan/in final year of contract so I guess this was inevitable. Steve Cooper said it was always the plan and I guess with inflation is could be practically the same as Fulham spent 4 years back.
Comment: Gibbs white for that price is theft
Comment: Yea I've already placed my bet on Nottingham winning the premier league
Comment: How has Chelsea’s hit £176 million?
Comment: You can’t compete in PL with championship side unfortunately you need to bring in players
Comment: This is the kind of crazy spending everyone assumed Newcastle would be doing when the takeover happened. Newcastle themselves, meanwhile, look like a paragon of fiscal responsibility compared to this. 

I love to see Forest back in the top flight, but I’m concerned about the owner and the money tue club is spending. My own club screwed this up spectacularly (though not nearly on this scale in terms of money spent on players) and nearly went under. Forest fans don’t deserve this happening to them.
Comment: From what I’ve heard/watched, didn’t they basically have to rebuild the entire team after earning promotion since half their team was on loan? Idk if their 140million is as quality as Chelsea’s 170. I don’t think Nottingham will be pushing for a title haha but they may stay up!
Comment: It's possible, but historically, high spending newly promoted sides haven't seen a good return on their money.
Comment: Yes. Logo is fire
Comment: Will it get them into European football again this year or anytime in the near future? Hell no. Will it keep them in the Premier League for a decent little run? Most likely
Comment: QPR flashbacks
Comment: It's one of them things. They have to do it, even if it's not the responsible thing to do. Staying up comes with such a huge windfall that gambling on spending big is the only option.
Comment: Even if they go down the parachute payments will recover that over 2/3 years. Most players will probably have relegation clauses and be able to sell for money. But if they stay up itll be well worth it. So yeah, worth it one way or another.
Comment: Of course, it will be worth it. They only need to stay away from relegation.
Comment: I mean if they stay up that pretty much pays for itself doesn't it?
Comment: If they are relegated this season they are in some seriously deep shite. Thats pretty much all I have to say on the matter.
Comment: Yh cause even if they get relegated they’ll just jump right back up then next season and can strengthen more cause if parachute payments

Comment: Honestly, no idea how Forest didn't score 3-4 goals.
Comment: Hahaha 115 joke amirite? This sub is boring af (not Ops fault)
Comment: I thought we were terrific today. We gave City a good game, caused them loads of problems and we didn't deserve to lose. We were the better team with the better chances for the first hour at least. 

We were unfortunately with the first goal; corners have been our undoing all season but with this one we were down to 10 men and it was Nico Williams's (who was at the side of the pitch injured) man who scored at the near post. 

Wood missed two tap ins, although one was a good block.

Four great chances created, all of which should have been goals but for a bit of bad luck and our own poor finishing. City had three good chances and scored two of them, and that's the difference.

I'm sorry to Arsenal fans that we couldn't hand you the title, but in the spirit of "anybody but Liverpool" I can live with this one. 

It is nice to lose a game and the referee not having a part in it for a change
Comment: Peepeepoopoo ass CF that Chris Wood
Comment: Oil bros are gonna do it again, sucks
Comment: I’d be surprised if Chris wood finished his tea after that game

Couldn’t hit a barn door yesterday
Comment: This is an off season from City, that's what many don't get. This City team is a contender for worst team in the Guardiola era aside from his 1st season, mainly but not exclusively due to treble hangover.

A mediocre season from Liverpool is a sub 70 points season, a mediocre season from City is still a 80+ season. There are levels to this.

You are watching a mediocre City side against the best Arsenal team in like 15 years.
Comment: MOTM Wood
Comment: Chris Wood is a Luton fan.
Comment: If Awonyi was playing today rather than the lump of wood who was up front, Forest might have got a point.
Comment: Good effort from Nottingham, some nice play but poor finishing. Elanga? out running Walker was fun to watch but inevitably KDB won the game. His play with Haaland is just a thing of beauty.
Comment: My thoughts are. Why did I watch when I knew the outcome beforehand. Why do I do this to myself?

😭
Comment: Unfortunately that's Forest down now
Comment: Why on Earth didn't Forest name the sub before the corner? It was obvious that Williams done his hamstring. Given Forest's general inability to defend set pieces, he should've sat on the ground until Montiel was ready. 

Same for Murillo. Clearly had some injury and needed to come off but stays on and gets done by Haaland (though that might have happened anyway)!

Whose fault? Nuno?
Comment: Dread it, run from it…
Comment: To be fair forest couldn’t score into an open net at the rate they were going. Have their self to blame as city weren’t exactly good today.
Comment: How could Stuart Atwell do this!!
Comment: Woody woody woody
Shud have been 2-0 up
Comment: Pitch caused a bobble each time Wood missed
Comment: Hard to believe the same striker that got a Hat Trick vs Newcastle and has scored so many crucial goals this season missed 2 absolute sitters.

But such is Forests inconsistency this season.

Overall it shows Forest do have the ability and quality to stay up, they just need the same amount of drive in the important games VS Sheffield and Burnley.

Comment: Top banter.

Their fans were also singing "Champions of Europe, you'll never sing that" taking the piss out of our usual song to them, and our reply was;

"Champions of Europe, you've only got one".
Comment: We love Emptihad banter, but their away fans really are pretty funny
Comment: Haha to be honest that’s funny, people need to understand that this is done ironically and it was funny I was there.
Comment: Half of the comments not understanding ironic banter
Comment: Based on the replies in here I think it’s safe to say that users of this sub should steer very clear of ever going to an actual prem game cause they will hate it. Some simple ironic banter has this place in a fucking shambles as it is hahahaha
Comment: lol I’m a Forest fan and find this funny as fuck. Lance Armstrong has humour
Comment: Damn. All 38 of them were singing that song?
Comment: Clearly joking around no clue why people are taking it so seriously. Think they did it against Everton too, it's really not the end of the world.
Comment: It’s so funny how many ppl in here don’t understand the joke
Comment: I love city fans are just going full heel and don't give a fuck about the charges.
Comment: Did all 6 of them join in?
Comment: Surely not redditors missing an obvious joke
Comment: 99% of people getting tilted and one single smart person in the comments pointed out that no, not every single one of the fans chanting is somehow unaware of the 115 charges, it's called irony lmao 


People being like "tHe AuDaCiTy" yeah that's the point man
Comment: No way people actually think the chant is serious. It’s having fun with the situation, not that deep
Comment: We know what you mean, We know what you meeeean. Takes one to know one, One Hundred Fifteen!!!!
Comment: City get a lot of hate, but this is really funny. Fair play.
Comment: to the unintelligent people. the joke is they are very famously accused of much worse cheating but havent been punished.

its why its funny.

Its like Tony Soprano making fun of people for being fat, when he himself is very obese
Comment: If you ever want to determine how many US-redditors are lurking on a particular sub, just look through the reactions to something that's clearly tongue-in-cheek, ironic or sarcastic.
Comment: I lolled. They are clearly taking the piss out of themselves
Comment: Honestly great banter that

Comment: Any club could face a points deduction if found in breech of FFP rules.

Thats the entire point of the rules.
Comment: I mean it’s not surprised considering they signed about 200 players last year
Comment: Conspiracy to keep Luton up
Comment: All a ploy. League’s conspiring with Forest so that after the deduction Nuno goes full Dyche and wins the league
Comment: Walking a fine line when the Fat Greek can make people dissappear.
Comment: Wolves were also warned and decided to sell accordingly. They had to start the new season +£85 million, so Neves and Numes and a few others went. The boss got a load of stick from fans who don’t understand simples maths and the rules, but it’s worked pretty good for the club.

The decision was to complete this 3rd season within budget so they no longer had the low income / Championship income / year hanging over them that Forest are still struggling with.
Comment: They should've broken 115 of them.
Comment: New Rule: If you're in the drop zone, you get to break FFP Rules.    

Seriously, how do you break the rules and still suck?
Comment: And show me one article which says Man City could face . . . 

Let alone facing it , they can't even say "could" when its Man City
Comment: Low hanging fruit...
Comment: This is the Premier League version of "If you owe £1,000 you have a problem. If you owe £1,000,000,000 *they* have a problem."

If a small team breaks the rules, it has a problem. If a big team breaks the rules the EPL has a problem.
Comment: There is huge financial incentive to stay up once promoted so investment (even into debt) seems to be the correct course - assuming the promoted team stays up and will earn enough prize money to pay off said debt. Otherwise the system is just a barrier to up and coming promoted teams that don’t have a recent Premier League presence and following a la Leicester, Leeds, Southampton, etc. and will continue to protect the established teams which was a huge criticism of FFP and to a lesser extent PSR when introduced. 

Teams are “allowed” to lose up to 105 million pounds in a three year window and Forest have only been up for two seasons, they should be allowed another year to get their debts in order.
Comment: Taking little bites of the wee clubs so when City's day comes there's a fuck-ton of precedents set. Guaranteed.
Comment: Any and all investigations into any club should be placed on hold and all manpower directed towards resolving the pending City charges. 

It's a fucking national disgrace that they're sanctioning Everton, Forest et Al whilst allowing that shower of shite to run roughshot over the Premier League.
Comment: In before bu bu bu but…….. citeh …. Oops I’m too late
Comment: Damn!! They should have avoided beating Man United, look now.
Comment: Nothing baits out the knuckle draggers quite like a vague ffp article the fuckwits cannot grasp.
Comment: Worth it to snap up Prime Chris Wood tbh
Comment: I don’t get the hatred of FFP. Biggest benefit is that it eases transfer fee inflation and rewards clubs who go for long term growth over short term fixes. 

Forest’s spending was excessive and unnecessary had they been a well run team (see Luton this season competing without over spending).

I get the issues with big teams and their entrenched advantages but ultimately that’s better than allowing rich owners to turn up, spend heavily over a short term and distort the market.
Comment: MC?

Comment: What is even the point of such a role when PGMOL are unquestionable and fine anyone who speaks up against them
Comment: Mark Clattenburg was a shit ref and admitted to deliberately ballsing up the spuds Chelski match. It is rumoured he’s universally disliked even amongst the referees.

Appointing an incompetent, disliked agitator and turncoat did more harm than good. Who’d have thought?
Comment: [deleted]
Comment: That was quick, unlike VAR
Comment: What an unreal gig to have for what I assume was a decent wage. 

“Yeah you guys got screwed on those decisions. Do a Tweet about it I reckon”

That’ll be £5,000 in consultancy fees
Comment: Stick to Gladiators, Mark, that’s your level these days…

Does anyone think having a referee analyst isn’t actually the worst idea in the world? 

But more as someone who can review decisions from the previous game and potentially explain to the coach and players the letter of the law and why the officials came to the decision, and maybe they can incorporate the feedback into the next match, rather than waring with current officials.
Comment: Yes but think of the friendships he made along the way :)
Comment: And there goes the easiest money a prem club has ever given away. Utterly bizzare.
Comment: Because refereeing decisions now defy analysis.
Comment: Clattenburg, you will join on my first whistle
Clattenburg, you will resign on my second whistle
Comment: On behalf of everyone in football - what a fucking cunt.
Comment: That statement reads to me "the PGMOL is corrupt as **** have been punishing Forest for my appointment with shit decisions as revenge for my appointment"

Then you have Sky pundits lambasting Forest for having a referee's consultant before cutting to the studio to speak to their referees consultant about the decisions in the game.
Comment: Trying to use the shady tactics that work in Greece was a hilarious move to begin with.
Comment: Never really understood what he was there to do anyway. He can’t exactly re-ref VAR decisions and even if he disagreed there’s fuck all he could do to help Forest anymore than any other complaining.
Comment: Twat
Comment: What a productive job that was.
Comment: What a total rat bastard this guy is
Comment: Clownish club and a clownish guy
Comment: Yeah go out on a high Mark.
Comment: Womp womp

Comment: Right now I can’t think of three teams worse than them so my answer would be yes 

But surely those signings at some point will gel, honestly who knows
Comment: If I was a betting man I’d put money on them to go down, but a lot can change in a season and with the big break in November it may make a huge difference. But usually you have other teams struggling and currently the other two down there are Leicester and West Ham, both with really strong squads that would likely find form with a manager change.
Comment: I still think they'll stay up but they will be in the relegation battle. That Fulham result was a kick in the balls.
Comment: Crazy thing about spending 170 mil. in the EPL is that you only get 3 to 4 mediocre English players.
Comment: Nottingham is using the WC as part of their strategy to stay up.  The bulk of the players they've signed are not playing in the WC which gives them an extra month to work on integrating that horde of players.  It's definitely a gamble but I think their results will greatly improve after WC break.
Comment: Forest fan here. Honestly, if handed 17th before the season started, I’d have ripped your hand off. Anything else would be a bonus. It’s not the days of Clough anymore (winning the league straight after promotion), or even Clark (finishing third after promotion and qualifying for what was then the UEFA Cup), and just being in the thing was a dream this time last year. The Fulham result was a kick in the teeth, more than the one against Bournemouth imo, but so long as Forest are 17th come the end of the season, mission accomplished. It’s looking like a battle, but there’s no reason to be writing the season off just yet.
Comment: Either relegated easily or it’ll be final day stuff. Hey ho we weren’t meant to go up in the first place so it’s all been a bit of a scramble to be competitive. Trusting Cooper, we won’t find better
Comment: Is there a good chance? Yeah, problem we have is our playstyle relying on having a very solid back 3, and we played well against Fulham until everyone lost the plot for 10 minutes. I think Forest after the international break will be what we judge them by.
Comment: Cooper and Forest have shown the ability to recover from a poor start. They just have to do the same thing they did last season at, say, 30% of the success rate and with better players. 

Notably, they haven't been totally blown out of the water by the teams close to their level. Just lack of chemistry and an injured back line have lead to collapses. Compared to this time last year there's a lot more to be hopeful about. Not only is a turn around possible, I think it's likely. Especially with the world cup break.
Comment: Wolves,  Leicester & Bournemouth are the worst imo.
Comment: It’s amazing how 2 games change the narrative after people found us ‘impressive’ against Tottenham. 

Reality is early season there’ll be teething problems but we had the same points tally at this point last year in the championship.

I’m not saying we’ll win every game and challenge europe but writing off any team at this stage is ludicrous. It’s also important to remember our best defender and one of our best midfielders are our injured at the moment. I’m not pretending we’ve been great but there’s a lot of games to be played and we can’t be written off. Nor can any team
Comment: I hope they have relegation releases in those contracts. To be honest I think they will go and can see cooper becoming under huge pressure from the owner. Remember he also owns olympiakos and spent huge sums of money on both.
Comment: I think the real figure is £152 million (link below) and that's an upper limit as a lot of that will include add ons. If we get relegated we definitely won't be paying the full £152 million.

Will we go down? At this point it's more likely than not, we'll probably improve, but it's a question of how fast do we improve and by how much. 

  https://theathletic.com/3555077/2022/09/02/nottingham-forest-deadline-day-review/
Comment: No, I think it'll work out eventually. It's just really not doing that right now
Comment: It's hard to say as they do actually have a lot of quality going forward and a good goalkeeper in Henderson

But their backline and midfield are absolutely horrific and Cooper is really visibly struggling to figure out his best eleven following an absolutely enormous squad overhaul

They could definitely be another Fulham depending on whether they stick by the manager and eventually get it right.
Comment: Unlikely. They’ve built a team which will mostly stay in tact when they get relegated. They’re obviously hoping they can somehow stay up but will have been under no illusions and probably given 1-2 players relegation releases clauses.

I’d say Forest and Bournemouth are favourites for rock bottom.
Comment: How they look after the WC break will be what I'd look for, in a normal season I'd probably conclude they won't make it but that extra month for their players to gel might be enough to keep them up. Personally I'm rooting for them.
Comment: I’m not a supporter but I do like the team and be a shame having waited 23 years to get relegated would be brutal , I prefer Leicester to go down though ;))
Comment: Nahh
Comment: I’m glad that I don’t see many people here talking about us being relegation candidates…

Comment: Forest.  How long has it been?  They played well in the FA Cup this year.  A club with a storied history as well.

Edit:  I think this is my first award.  Thank you all.
Damn, 1k up votes.  Thank you.
Comment: Forest because Huddersfield were in the prem a few years ago and they are boring
Comment: Nottingham because of all the potential "Robin Hood" memes
Comment: I think Huddersfield are a really good club, but I'd love to see Forest back in the Prem. Fantastic club with great history, and the atmosphere at The City Ground is magnificent - I've had some brilliant times there.
Comment: Forest! Lived in Nottingham for a while. Have an amazing history. Huddersfield we’re there not long ago. Give someone else a crack!
Comment: Forest mainly based on being the bigger club and their past achievements.

Beat us in the semis even though we were evenly matched over the two legs but would be nice to say we lost against the winners.
Comment: Town because they seem a lot more likely to take up a relegation spot
Comment: Nottingham Forest. Didn't they win a CL?
Comment: Forest always nice to see someone new come up that haven’t been in the prem for years. Play good football got a good manager with some decent players and guaranteed to take 6 points from Arsenal. Don’t think Huddersfield would really offer much and probably go straight back down.
Comment: Defo Forrest. Club with a bit of history, back where they belong!
Comment: Forest because I lost 5-2 to Huddersfield on FIFA
Comment: It does make me laugh,

People were begging for Everton to go down, but they have "history"

But because forest have history, everyone wants them up?
Comment: Forest, always remember watching the games in the old div 1 against us when I was a young lad.
Comment: Huddersfield. Though I'm not strictly 'neutral'. The company I used to work for, which I hate, is a Forest sponsor and their logo is all over the ground. Don't wanna see that on Match of the Day or an away game!
Comment: Its about time
Comment: Forest. Brings back memories of watching Stan Collymore “back in the day.” Badass.
Comment: Huddersfield. Corberán is a real talent and I can stay at my Grans house if I get an away ticket.
Comment: Huddlesfield cos Yorkshire
Comment: Forest!
Comment: This would’ve been interesting as a poll, but personally I’d like to see Forest in the prem

Huddersfield is also a decent historical team (3 league titles in a row, first to do it, had more leagues than Man United back then) 

But Forest haven’t been in the prem for a while so they would be more interesting, and it would be funny to hear the Forest fans sing “Champions of Europe, you’ll never sing that” to Man City, Arsenal etc.

Comment: Reece James, what a player! Talk about instant impact, James just produced that trademark run in no time and created a goal instantly.
Comment: Really enjoyed that game. I have to say though it’s far less about Chelsea subs although sterling goals was great, but Forest yet again can’t read the room, we were on top and generally looked comfortable… so what do we do time and time again….. disrupt the balance because players were tired… fucking tired… lol
Very poor game management from Nuno, a real key weakness of his and I hope he’s acknowledged this fuck up. 

Overall happy with Forest though, we sort the set pieces issues out, we’ll make huge progress next season
Comment: Absolutely, if you can bring players like Sterling, James and Nkunku on then you can always change a games- one that we were well on top of at the time.

However, another factor was our substitutions. Nuno got ours totally wrong and Chelsea scored straight after from the rearranged fullbacks
Comment: Yesterdya showed why Chelsea's long injury list has hindered Poch this whole season because with most players out, there is little tactical flexibility that he can have plus he does not have a chance to bring quality players on, especially attacking players, and try to change the course of a game.

Having James, Gusto, and Nkunku back for the final 2 games is immense for sure.

Comment: It was destined to be like this, palmers assist -mudryk goal, sterling comes off and score, reece james came after a century provided an assist and jackson scored! If Nkunku had scored then it would have been cherry on top!
Comment: Chelsea's 9 man bench (€188.20m) was bought for almost twice as much at Forests starting 11 (€102.60m) and is worth over 3 times more (€325.00m).


3 of Chelsea's 4 subs, Sterling (€56.20m), Gusto (€30.0m) and Nkunku (€60.0m) cost about €40 million more than Forests entire starting 11. James was free obviously.     


So yeah, I'd hope Chelsea bringing on that much talent and firepower against relegation strugglers would have an effect. 

Comment: Mfw people are shocked that fanbases hate stagnant uninspired football and want change
Comment: For years and years we were told by other fans “be careful what you wish for” it’s frustrating as fuck, just consider for a moment the fans of the actual club might have a bit more insight than yourselves.
Comment: Unless West Ham get outside investment to compete with the top 6 then it’s pointless what they do.   Moyes has them ticking along nicely.
Comment: Why doesn’t he just win every game? Is he fucking stupid or something?
Comment: What do they expect? Top 4? Deluded every last one. They will get some random foreign manager in and finish 15th
Comment: I mean calling for his head when he very publicly didn’t get what he thought he needed in the summer transfer window is a bit much. 

Yeah this season hasn’t been great but there would always be a period of adjustment after Rice leaving.
Comment: Moyes should get to take that European trophy with him when he's made to pack his bags. The ungrateful gits
Comment: If you are a football supporter you can understand
Comment: It's easy for other fans to criticise from the outside and look at what West Ham have done and wonder what the problem is.

But they have some really good players. They have a huge stadium and mostly fill it, and  that should put them more or less permanently in the top half. 

Yes they've had some success but Moyes has taken the club as far as he is capable and it's easy from the outside to dismiss it and say that's as far as the club can go. But I can't blame their fans for believing their club can go further than Moyes can take them
Comment: And hire who? Pep?
Comment: Moyes is a tactical sodomite.
Comment: this is like an annual thing with West Ham at this point.
Comment: I would like to know who this miracle manager is that can come in and get West Ham finishing in Europe every season and winning cups.

The reality is that West Ham is about the 9th or 10th best side in the league and that's where they are. They did very well in 2023 by beating the likes of Spurs, Man United and Arsenal but that run wasn't going to last forever. 

They want a manager that can get them consistent results, get them playing better football and who is available and willing to take the job. If any West Ham fan can come up with a name that ticks all the boxes then that would be great. People love to talk but they never actually come up with any solutions that would improve the so-called dire situation that they're in.
Comment: Yes, football is a results business and Moyes has done wonders in that sense. But given the quality of players he has, much of the football this season has been dire. West Ham fans pride themselves on stylish attacking teams, and I don’t think it’s for fans of other sides to judge what should please them and what doesn’t. 
The discontent was there long before this dodgy run.
Comment: If you look at what villa is doing, definitely it's understandable why they would be pissed
Comment: Westham fans want relegation fights so bad playing spurs like football 🤣🤣 grass always isn't greener they'll regret it they should just accept their Midtable the other manager will not win Europe as Moyes did.... So funny 🤣
Comment: It's gonna be hilarious when they appoint a little known foreign manager and they promptly get relegated. Moyes back in. Careful what you wish for hammers fans. You were down a division not so long ago and last season he won you a European trophy so wtf please.
Comment: Only the second post in the last 20 minutes in this sub about this. Can mods just create a super-thread for all the fans of other teams who want to tell us what we should and shouldn’t be grateful for?
Comment: Two things can be true,  Moyes teams plays quite unattractive, boring and some say dire ball yet under him West Ham and Everton in the past got results from that. He is West Ham most successful manager won a European cup made Europa twice, a top 6 finish and a top 8 one so far this year. As a Hammer you cannot ask more than that. WHU fans are getting greedy they are usually in the table 11th-16th . Be careful what you wish for.
Comment: Print out a nice banner: May aswell get best use out instead of leaving it in the garage from 2018

Comment: I understand it is an independent panel and I will inherently be bias but surely consistency is key. The foul on Gio has been given multiple times this season and the handball was given later the same day.
Comment: The third one not being given is a disgrace to football and var.
Comment: 1? 1 penalty? Is this their way of saying we messed up but won't admit it cost forest points?
Comment: That'll be a 3 point deduction for Everton and an all expenses paid trip to Dubai for Mr Taylor and his mates.
Comment: I’m sure Forest fans are happy to hear this after the fact 🙄

I swear VAR has had such a negative impact on football. Was watching some old LFC season reviews earlier and before the introduction of VAR football was so much more fun to watch.
Comment: The fact the last one wasn't given, considering that was the most obvious, stonewall one and it had come after 2 very subjective difficult decisions that could have gone either way, is straight up stupid to be honest. That is the one the panel said should have been a penalty. I don't see the point in video assistance if you're missing pens like that, I actually think the ref is more likely to give that one if there's no VAR, given the context of the game.
Comment: Always nice to know you should have had a penalty after the fact, and that it was wrongly reviewed by incompetent people. That always helps getting points doesn’t it…
Comment: Okay but why is it always Anthony Taylor?

I swear every time there is controversy with the Refs his name always pops up.
Comment: It does make me wonder what the point of this is....yes it kinda vindicates Forest's twitter moaning but it's not like they can go back and amend the game.

Like the Liverpool / Spurs fiasco earlier in the season apparently It's done, dusted and written in stone as soon as the next whistle is blown.

All the apology phone caljs from Webb on a Monday morning aren't gonna get teams their goals or points back.
Comment: What's the point of these investigations? You ain't getting any points from it
Comment: This is happening every week. Scrap var. It's 100x more frustrating knowing they have the technology to fix refereeing mistakes in games but are too incompetent to use it
Comment: The problem for Forest fans is everyone on the planet knows the third incident is a penalty. So when you go back, the handball is given all the time and the first incident is sometimes given. So Forest fans can just assume based on the third incident not given that they were screwed on the first 2 also. You just can't screw up the third incident this badly and then expect people to trust you on the first 2. VAR has to get better. Get the refs who are protecting their friends out of VAR and bring in impartial officials who only do VAR. Also fix the handball rule, at this point either never give handball or give it everytime, because at least it would be consistent.
Comment: We would only ever have had one anyway. Give any one of them and the game changes completely and the situations leading to the later ones don't happen
Comment: Can we also have an investigation on why Chris Wood can’t tap the ball in from 6 yards out?
Comment: I agree with them. Two correct calls and one mistake.
Comment: The second and third were clear and obvious errors. But 

> when the ball hit Young's arm in the 44th minute, but all agreed VAR was correct not to intervene.

Why was VAR correct when Young clearly had his arms up and redirected the ball?
Comment: Sure Forest are delighted to hear this 🤦

Comment: "No clear action by the defender"

As young kicks Hudson-Odoi from behind.....
Comment: The headline is misleading. What the panel actually rules was that the handball was a subjective call with a 3-2 verdict against a penalty. This men's that had a penalty been awarded it would not have been overturned.

One  incident was ruled not a penalty with a 5-0 verdict meaning it would have almost certainly been overruled by VAR.

This leaves us with the final incident which was ruled a penalty witha 5-0 verdict and a similar 5-0 verdict suggesting VAR should have been used.

So one maybe, one definitely and wan definitely not. That isn't the same as saying that only one was missed.

Comment: I love how you can ban and fine players for gambling on games that they play in, as you absolutely should because they can directly influence them through their actions.  

But the second you suggest that the individuals who have more influence on the game than anyone else may also be susceptible to this, you get shouted out. 

At what point does one start delving deeper into the mess and not just take everything as "human error"?

Certain clubs have a long history of diabolical decisions coming from the same referees over the course of years. 

Micheal Oliver is allowed to go and ref in the UAE and be paid to do so by the owners of Manchester city and then return and officiate Manchester city games. Does that seem like a conflict of interest? 

It's nothing more than pure hubris of the FA and the mouthpieces on the Sky Sports etc that say you can't question the integrity of the referee's in the league. Just go and ask the Italians about Calciopoli.
Comment: It should be the standard practice, the fans should know what are the referees and VAR arguments for their decision
Comment: It should be public.  The FA is trying to keep issues swept under the rug. Not just this but others.
Comment: Shame on Gary Neville for being a corporate man and talking like the PGMOL is 100% corruption free
Comment: Should be public anyways
Comment: 20 teams should meet up and form a breakaway league.
Comment: Not sure what they’re expecting to hear? “Looks a penalty but I love Luton so nah not happening”.
Comment: I hope more teams start doing this. If nobody ever calls the PGMOL on their shit, they'll never have to answer for it. Wouldn't be surprised if they just refuse to release the audio, though...

Anyone have a link to the highlights? The NBC version on YouTube has very conveniently not included any of these moments 😏
Comment: My prediction;

This will be released; it has to be after they did it for Liverpool.

It will tell us nothing. You'll hear Attwell repeating the same flawed thinking that Taylor used to not give them in the first place. That third one you'll hear him either repeating that their player gets the ball (he doesn't) or warping reality and claiming there isn't enough contact. 

Basically, you'll hear Attwell making up excuses not to change Taylor's decisions. It will be nothing more bombshell than that 

What I am actually really pleased with has been the solidarity of fans on social media. There are a lot of fans backing us here who are utterly pissed off with the appalling standard of officiating. 

I've seen my team in three different divisions and League One was miles better than this
Comment: All 3 shouts were legit penalties. Forest were robbed. Someone should definitely get punished. And I’m not talking “demoted” to ref champions games “punishment.”
Comment: what stops pgmol from editing the audio?
Comment: As an everton fan who has had his fair share of gutting ass fucked by VAR. Forrest got ass fucked. 

Go on Forrest.
Comment: VAR has failed, I think. Maybe we should make it only as an automatic tool for offsides and bring everything else back to how it was, but give the teams 1 challenge per half. During a challenge the referee would go to the screen and decide ALONE if the outcome should be changed.
Comment: Well done lads, good process
Comment: I cant remember how many times i have said this season, CHEQUE COMPLETE. The beautiful game we love has been taken from us and monetized. Money money money, must be funny. Disgusting from PiGMOL and FAscists.
Comment: Let's not ignore Anthony Taylor in all this. Abysmal referee.
Comment: I wish forest good luck with this. I am sick of this referees are like the pope completely infallible. And unquestionable. Carra and Nev would sicken you yesterday and sky. Oh you can't say that. Why not. The system is a joke.
Comment: Corruption. They fine you when you speak out on their bullshit. FA stands for FAscist.
Comment: Video in the VAR booth too! Atwell in full Luton kit.
Comment: I mean good for them because that was suspect officiating but what do they expect it to prove? Var saying he's a Luton fan so nah it wasn't a handball?
