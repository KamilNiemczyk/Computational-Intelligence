Comment: Lopetegui "So... I can't get anybody for the season... ight... imma head out". I guess. 

  Gary O'Neil "Ok, I can do that"
Comment: Wish him all the best, still wish our board gave him more of a chance.
Comment: I don't think this will end well
Comment: Last season Scott Parker threw his toys out of the pram, unhappy with the board's player recruitment. He was removed and O'Neil came in and did a fantastic job.

Now things are repeating themselves. This time Lopetegui is unhappy with recruitment, the club have let him go and O'Neil is in. I think O'Neil will do well too.

Comment: Just like the other post, the question needs to be more specific. Do you mean who had the directly more successful season, or who had the most successful season based on previous success.  

If it's the former, then Man Utd - they finished higher in the league and neither team won a trophy.  

If it's the latter then Wolves - they are recently promoted and 7th would have been way above expectations, plus reaching the semi final of the cup which was unlikely to be expected either.
Comment: Considering return on investment and also brand perception, then clearly Wolves has the upper hand here.

Manchester United is not being seen as a behemoth anymore, and they may suffer in attracting casual supporters in the future.

Wolves is now seen as an exciting underdog, full of interesting players, and it has been attracting new supporters quickly.
Comment: As a United fan 

If you look at in terms of expectations Wolves hands down had a better season but not just United but a better season than Arsenal too.
Comment: wolves <3
Comment: Pretty obviously Wolves
Comment: The Wanderers of Wolverhampton.
Comment: I just came here to say.... awooooooooooooo

(wolves)
Comment: At the start of the season these clubs had different expectations and different understandings of what would be required for a season to be a success.

For Utd, a top 4 finish would have been the top priority, a decent run in the UCL, and perhaps some domestic cup success for the icing on the cap. For Wolves, staying up would have been the top priority with a cup run added in if possible.  

By those metrics, Wolves smashed it out of the park and Utd were a disaster.
Comment: This was probably made only to take the piss out of Man Utd.
Comment: Wolves clearly. How is this even a question?
Comment: Based on expectations going in it has to be 100% wolves
Comment: Wolves, hands down, no contest. 

I see what you're doing here, trying to look at only the league standings. But considering ManU's wage bill and that Wolves are a newly promoted side...it's easily that Wolves had the better season. Tbh, I think 1-on-1, Wolves would beat ManU.
Comment: Cheers for the shout out 😉
Comment: Wolves without a doubt, Man U made a mediocre season. We all know that.
Comment: Wolves. They made it to the fa cup semis and clinched Europa league qualification.
Comment: Wolves, obviously. I'm not going to list the very obvious reasons why. I had a soft spot for this team, for aesthetic reasons (the name, badge, colors, kits), and hoped they would beat relegation in 2012. Now that they are back, they have won me over with their football (and my God, those kits!). I have fallen in love with them. Hope they do well in Europa.
Comment: Wolves have clearly had a better season in terms of what is expected of the 2 clubs. Not even up for debate
Comment: Are you just looking for people to shit on United? Clearly Wolves had a better season all things considered. Great transfers, played and finished at a higher level than most people expected. One game away from a cup final, it’s pretty obvious.
Comment: United got more points and had a decent champions league campaign, so objectively them. When Man City win the league you don't day they didn't have a good season because of how much money they spent.

Of course football isn't really objective, so Wolves.

Comment: Portugal FC doin the business

Comment: Moutinho is the most under-appreciated player in the league
Comment: Yeah I agree. We need to play Pogba in CAM so that we could pass forwards more often instead of just passing it back for possesion etc. Also, maybe Lingard should’ve gotten a lower score. He has been useless for the past two Gameweeks.

Comment: Wow Ryan Giggs has more trophies than every English team in their history besides United Liverpool and Arsenal
Comment: I've always thought their 6 CL Vs Man Utd 3 gives them the edge regardless.
Comment: You could've added just a few more teams so that we would've been there :(
Comment: Well I hope we add the Europa League to our tally.
Comment: Seems like this counts the community shield, which can't really be described as competitive. It used to be shared when the team drew
Comment: At least this year
Comment: Did not expect Arsenal to be miles above Chelsea. I thought the difference would be like 5 cups at most.
Comment: This EFL Cup final will not only be Tottenham's chance to win their first trophy in 13 years but a chance for both clubs to have the sole spot for 5th most decorated
Comment: if you only count major trophies we are the most decorated club regardless, nobody cares about the community shield or trophies like that tbh
Comment: What does most decorated club mean, just most number of trophies won or is there any criteria ?
Comment: Ahhh, so we’re counting the preseason friendly Community Shield? So is Arsenal allowed to include the AUDI Cup as well? Major, actual trophies, Liverpool has the most.
Comment: Liverpool still overtake them in major trophies won
Comment: 14th in most decorated teams in England, you'll never sing that.
Comment: Tbh in trophy count, Liverpool is far from surpassing United if you count the glorious Twitter .jpeg memes and slanders and Mourinho putting his 2017 runners up as one of his greatest accomplishments
Comment: Charity Shields shouldn't be included.

Comment: And absolutely grotesque that David Luiz was allowed to continue as well. Teams need a free substitution for concussions. Anything else is encouraging dangerous behavior.
Comment: Headbutt knockouts are brutal anyway, let alone one that you didn't see coming. Anytime you get hit in the head when you aren't expecting it you have a crazy increased chance at getting knocked out.

So when we eventually get our hands on this years title we would have been level

I guess the old saying of cheats never prosper doesn't apply to city

Any comment that essentially says “if we win the treble” in February like it’s akin to waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth half asleep is foolhardy bordering on arrogance.

Liverpool are a top team but the reason I love football is because any team can lose due to the nature of the game and the value one goal has in terms of tactics and how it shifts the way the game is played.

However, I would say Konate is the real deal. Great defender coming up.

Comment: On current evidence I would say selling Grealish for £100 million is up there…

Gerrard has had a good start, but it’s a bit soon to judge.
Comment: Chelsea really streamlined their books
Comment: Arsenal - Takehiro Tomiyasu and Martin Ødegaard
Comment: Keeping Raphinha wasn’t really “business” related. We only signed him last year and he didn’t play much for the first half of the season. He was good but nobody was really knocking in the summer. If we keep him next summer then it’ll be “good business”. 

We didn’t really do much of anything transfer wise in the summer. Bought Dan James for £25-30m but that’s neither good nor bad I feel. 

At a push I’d say the club looking attractive enough for Bielsa to stay another year was good business.
Comment: >Liverpool - choosing Jota over Firmino

What? Firmino has been injured.
Comment: I’d say the takeover was the best piece of business
Comment: ibrahima konate has a super career ahead of him if he continues to perform the way he has, wonderful signing, however if liverpool close the deal on salahs new contract that may top it.
Comment: Brentford had no money to throw around but they are great at finding gems shame they all are getting injured
Comment: Willock+5m  for odegard is a ridiculous bit of good business
Comment: Along with backing Arteta at Arsenal, I would say that dropping Auba and putting faith in Martinelli and Laca has been a huge turning point in how we play.
Comment: liverpool fan here, starting thiago and jota surely
Comment: Business? Stavley & PIF coming in to save us from Mike Ashley
Comment: Bernardo Silva really changed the game this season for us. The man deserves another pay rise.


Comment: It’s crazy, going into every premier league weekend we now expect/know some bull shit will occur due to incompetent refs. Imagine this was the case in any other industry.
Comment: Do any city fans think the refs are corrupt against them? I haven’t heard that one.
Comment: I continue to look, along with rugby and their excellent review system, at refereeing in the major North American sports leagues.

In 1988, NBA basketball added a third referee, realizing that the players were too large and too fast for only two referees to follow. All three call fouls.

In 1999, NHL hockey added a second referee to go with the original ref and two linesman system, making it 4 game officials. Both refs can call penalties and linesmen can advise.

American football has eight on field officials and numerous task officials. Every one of the eight can call a penalty and they each watch only one small portion of the play.

In each league, video augments the officiating in some capacity, because even with extra refs, some things are too difficult to see and can be missed. 

The idea that you might embarrass your mate is ludicrous, and officials that made more than one of the mistakes on the scale we’re seeing would be fired.

The officials are paid well and it is considered a profession. I’ve even seen standing ovations for officials in hockey that are retiring, because they have the respect of the fans.
Comment: [in all instances, this is what is actually going on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)
Comment: I think it's most likely just incompetence, but to outright deny even the possibility of corruption is just naive and myopic.

- Match fixing for gambling reasons doesn't always mean you favour certain teams, but instead cause certain betting outcomes to occur. E.g. no red cards...
- We've seen the whole match fixing scandal in Serie A happen in living memory, and even more recent memory we have a whole slew of players facing charges for breaking gambling rules.
- A number of refs have possible financial conflicts of interests as they are also being paid for refereeing work / consultancy in the U.A.E and Suadi Arabia
- Barcelona have their ongoing case wherein they were allegedly paying for more favourable treatment from referees.
- FIFA itself has had so much corruption come to light its not worth listing it all out. But worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia have been awarded the 2034 World cup.

But despite all the above, you'll just roll your eyes at the thought of any corruption because the Premier League is special and pure and it would never happen.

It's probably incompetency but I'm not as certain as you are.
Comment: It's not corruption, it's incompetence.
Comment: PGMOL isn't corrupt, but certain individuals (the ones who go to Saudi and get paid by them) are coming back days after being in Saudi and making the most atrocious calls which all happen to go in favour of City or Newcastle. 

I do not blame anyone for being suspicious.
Comment: This is the same old crap. It's been like this since the 80s when I started watching football, it's just now you can see the views of thousands of idiots in one consolidated place.
Comment: I adamantly agreed with this but yesterday did make me start wondering.

These guys are likely being paid a lot of money for the officiating they are doing in Saudi.

Now they may not be directly being bribed, but what if in the back of their mind they think theres a chance they might not get invited back to saudi for the exta payday if they dont make these decisions.

The officiating is appalling, but I am not sure I can explain Bruno not getting sent off with incompetence. 

Havertz wasnt a stonewall red, it was late slide tackle with one leading leg that clipped the back leg. It could have been a red, it could have been a yellow.

I dont think the refs are going to blatantly intervene on behalf of the saudis, in Havertz case thats what it would have been if they had.

But they very well may give them the benefit of the doubt where possible like they did with the goal and allowing Bruno to whatever he liked for 90 mins. Because in their own mind they might feel it could affect future paydays if they dont.
Comment: I don't think people generally think refs are against their specific team (I mean there will always be individuals that probably do think this). But instead people think refs are being influenced by "oil" money. 

Personally I think it's hard to not feel like this at times as some refs certainly have a conflict of interest and it's easy to make the accusation even if it might not be true. Who knows...
Comment: Honestly, the tin foil hat paranoid conspiracy theories do my head in more than the mistakes themselves.
Comment: Agree with your post 100%, it's conspiracy theory central in here at the moment.

However, while the quality of the refereeing is poor, it's not helped by fans and (some) pundits refusing to learn the laws of the game and how VAR works in practical terms.
Comment: I said this after the Liverpool Vs Tottenham game. Malice and incompetence are often confused with each other. The referees fucked up the goal decision. Does it make them hate Liverpool? Nope. Does it make them appear they need to be trained better and are performing below their expected standard? Yes. Every weekend there is another referee or VAR booboo. And it's not inhibiting specific teams, it's inhibiting the integrity of the league. Every time a poor decision is made, it effects all teams. And if the current crop of referees can't handle the workload, find/train better ones.
Comment: There are so many fans that think that every referee, pundit and media outlet is biased against them that I'm not sure who the bias is supposed to be for.

Don't think I've ever heard a fan say "you know what, that VAR official must be our chairman's best mate by allowing us that penalty and sending off their midfielder for no reason. And Sky really like us, they're always praising everything we do. The game wasn't great today but Match of the Day still put us on first when we should have been last. We're really getting all the luck right now."

Let's face it, refereeing has been attrocious across the board this year. VAR is a brilliant service which is being used incorrectly over and over again. Clubs all over the league are getting calls for and against them.
Comment: If you can go back and review the refereeing decisions in every Merseyside Derby of the Premier League era and prove to me that there's no bias, then I'll believe there's no corruption.
Comment: I know this isn't the point of your post but I don't understand how people think Havertz's tackle wasn't a red, it was so out of control he was literally flying with his boot up in the air. If contact had been made it was a definite leg breaker.
Comment: Totally agree. It both baffles and amuses me that people will put on a tinfoil hat so big it blinds them to, quite simply, poor refereeing.

It wouldn’t surprise me if this (the Newcastle goal) exact, or a very similar scenario, happened in another game between two ‘non-oil’ connected teams. And if it happened ten plus times over the rest of the season, there still wouldn’t be a definitive outcome.

Because, as mentioned before, of poor refereeing.
Comment: I don't think the refs are corrupt or bias against a particular clubs. If anything I think certain clubs and their fans use less-than-perfect refereeing as a comfort blanket, to deflect from their failings.
Comment: It's ludicrous because it cheapens genuine corruption clams. 

There were 3 games that I have seen that I felt were genuinely corrupt. 
1. Italy v South Korea 2002 World Cup. The ref just happened to get arrested a few years later for trafficking heroin through a US Airport. The Italy manager was mocked at the time for saying it was a conspiracy against Italy. 

2. Cagliari v Juventus in around 2004-05. The ref was giving Juve everything. The ref added on 5 minutes of injury time out of nowhere. Cannavaro scored with about 90 seconds left and the ref blew up and sprinted off the pitch. Then Calciopoli happened. 

3. Chelsea v Barcelona in the CL. Nothing has come of it but we are seeing the lengths of the what Barcelona would go to get games in their favour. 

People have to distinguish between bad decisions and corruption because when we do see genuine corruption they get swiped away as sour grapes.
Comment: I agree with you, but to play Devil’s Advocate, do you not think that some of the big clubs are at least trying to buy refs?

With all the corruption rife in FIFA, with how shady some of the ownership in the prem clearly is, you don’t think there’s any groups trying to do what the conspiracy theorist say is happening?

I think everything you’ve said is true and that these bad decisions don’t need to be attributed to corruption, but I also think that some of these bigger clubs will try to get advantages wherever they can, illegal or not.

Baggies, Sheff United, and Portsmouth have a decent shout of being there too.
Comment: Honestly couldn't make one. Sounds like a cop out but there is no definitive list. Any team playing in the league has earned their place that season, regardless of where they're from or what they have or haven't won
Comment: There should be no definitive list , reasons for teams being there or getting there are myriad. Thank god there is no set criteria. How boring that would be
Comment: One and two contradict each other because of Blackburn.
Comment: Largely agree, although Forest really not in the Premier League all-time 20 surely? Have had 6 total seasons including this year, of which 4 were 92-93 to 96-97. Did admittedly somehow come 3rd in one of those. But yeah, just not a team I think of as being in the Premier League era much at all. If they weren't in the league right now would you even have given them a second thought? Their last appearance would have been 1999!

Feels a bit harsh on Bolton (13 seasons) to be left out as well. Especially with that iconic Jay Jay Okacha team.
Comment: Surely it's the teams with the most seasons outside the relegation zone right + automatic PL title pass?

Edit: This is the list, with the one caveat being that i'm assuming there is no relegation this year. Some fairly notable omissions

Man Utd (30 seasons, 13 titles)

Chelsea (30,5)

Arsenal (30,3)

Liverpool (30,1)

Spurs (30,0)

Everton (30,0)

Comment: First three would be Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester United. Traditionally the three biggest clubs in England in terms of domestic success.

Chelsea and Manchester City have enjoyed success in more recent times but are undoubtedly huge clubs now. That’s the most obvious first five.

Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa have won European Cups, and Leicester City and Blackburn Rovers have won the Premier League. That’s us up to nine.

Tottenham and Everton are ever-presents who’ve never been relegated, so they’re in. West Ham and Newcastle are huge clubs in their own right, and have only been out of the top flight in rare occasions over the last 30 years. Leeds United have only recently returned but are a huge club as well. That’s fourteen.

I think the remaining six places are debatable, so I’d like to spread things out geographically a bit. I’d add in Sunderland for more representation for the North East, Wolverhampton Wanderers for the West Midlands, Sheffield Wednesday for Yorkshire, and Southampton for the south coast. That’s 18. 

The last two spots are really tough… I’d probably pick Crystal Palace and Brighton as my final two entries. Sheffield United, Middlesbrough, and West Brom were the other ones I’ve had in mind.
