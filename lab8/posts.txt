Discussion Thread - Manchester United VS Manchester City | FA Cup Final
**Venue -** *Wembley Stadium*  
**Kick-off** \- 2 P.M. GMT

**Lineups:**   
🔴**Manchester United** \-  *Onana, Wan-Bissaka, Varane, Martinez, Dalot, Mainoo, Amrabat, McTominay, Garnacho, Fernandes, Rashford.* 

🔵**Manchester City** \-  *Ortega, Walker, Stones, Ake, Gvardiol, Rodri, Kovacic, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Foden, Haaland.*  

I am so tired of hearing about the "class of 92".
Is anyone else completely and utterly mind numbingly bored of hearing stories from Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane crew *specifically about* "when I was at Manchester United" we did X Y or Z. Or "when Sir Alex was here" it would run like... Essentially continual comparing to how things were done with Manchester United and how stuff happened during the "class of 92" era. 

I am so tired of hearing this bloody same story told 5,000 different ways during commentary and punditry.

I don't care about this in 2024. The horse has been flogged and it's dead. Stop bringing it up, please!!

I don't mind them as people or pundits too much, talking specifically about the match or season, they're quite good at that. Keane is even really funny. But damn I am so bored of this story and hearing about stories of 1999 or when Neville and co used to play against Liverpool at Anfield and you'd want to try and get out with a point or whatever the comparison is. Time to move the f on!

I support a Championship team for what it is worth. This isn't coming from a bitter rival team fan.

Erik ten Hag on the reports he will be sacked: "2 trophies in 2 seasons and 3 finals… not bad. If they don't want me anymore, I go somewhere else and win trophies. That's what I've done my whole career"


Alejandro Garnacho's bicycle kick against Everton is the 2023/24 Goal of the Season!
Surely also a Puskás contender


'You had trouble to manage a team' - Erik ten Hag hits back at Roy Keane after FA Cup final victory


Manchester United are the first side to have two teenagers score for them in an FA Cup final. 


Pep Guardiola: Manchester City boss says he made FA Cup final tactical mistakes


Race for European football ends with Man Utd qualifying for Europa League and Newcastle missing out


[Squawka] Erik ten Hag is the first manager to win a major domestic cup final against Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City

Title: It looks like Haaland isn't a big game player.
Another big game has come and gone and Haaland hasn't performed. He's really not doing much to dispel the narrative that he can't contribute against the big teams and/or in important games. 

For a player as talented as he is, it's a bit mad that he can't seem to get it done against the better teams in crunch time. 
____________________________________________________________
Title: Jamie O'Hara says Man City will never be as big as Man United even if they win 6 UCLs and that City aren't comparable to Real Madrid, Barca, Liverpool etc. City are owned by a state & they’ve Pep Guardiola. But that will change.

Title: [Stone] Man Utd into Europa League, Chelsea into Conference League. No Europe for Newcastle.

____________________________________________________________
Title: City will change their strategy in hard games next year
We saw arsenal and now manchester united shut them down with a low block and the threat of fast attackers. City's low risk play isn't creating enough chances to get advantage in these games.

Imo next year, more of the top 5 will commit to that as a strategy and city will have to change it up.

I expect them to rely more on doku and silva (if he stays) taking on players directly, and i think they'll sign another winger and/or midfielder with this skillset.

To all the transfer junkies and speculators,

Who would you like to see your team bring in over the summer? Who would you like to see leave? Are there any other areas of the club you’d like to see improvement?

As a Liverpool fan, I’d most like to see what assistant staff are going to join Slot, replacing those that left with Klopp.

Vincent Kompany managed Burnley with his progressive style, but they struggled in the Premier League. Some say his coaching style might have caused their relegation, suggesting he cared more about his image than the team. But let's think about it: Kompany kept Burnley's old way of playing, which worked before, but not in the Premier League. Maybe it was because of tactics or how tough the league is. Blaming it all on Kompany seems too easy because if he switched his style then I can still see fans criticizing him for not keeping the tactics that brought them into the PL.

Guehi is part of the Three Lions' provisional squad for Euro 2024 after returning from a knee injury.

The 23-year-old has two years remaining on his deal at Selhurst Park.

Title: Hammers bid to beat Gunners to Kadioglu'
West Ham have reportedly launched a £22million bid to beat Arsenal to Fenerbahce's Ferdi Kadioglu.

[AS Marca](https://twitter.com/asmarcatr/status/1793233245833662516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1793233245833662516%7Ctwgr%5E57a0d2413991fbaccbda5e2146160ca3797f53b4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westhamzone.com%2Fcore%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php) say the Hammers are hungry to land the 24-year-old Turkey left-back.

Simple. I'm just interested to know peoples thoughts. The Premier League is pretty adamant it can regulate itself. Is this simply then trying to conserve their own power for the purposes of greed or do you think a regulator will re-manage the game in the way VAR has re-refereed football matches?

Title: Treble hero mooted for surprise return
Jap Stam is being linked with a surprise return to Manchester United - for a key new role.

The Dutchman was a defensive legend at Old Trafford despite staying just three years - partly as he was a 1999 Treble winner.

[TuttoMercatoWeb](https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/calcio-estero/manchester-united-contatti-per-il-ritorno-di-stam-puo-entrare-in-dirigenza-1971056) says Sir Jim Ratcliffe's new regime are interested in Stam becoming a link between players and management amid a backroom shake-up.

The UEFA Pro License holder, 51, scouted for United in 2008 before managing PEC Zwolle, Jong Ajax, Reading, Feyenoord and Cincinnati.

Manchester United have drawn up a two-man shortlist to solve their problematic left-back area.

According to [Sport Witness](https://sportwitness.co.uk/), United are targeting Wolves ace Rayan Ait-Nouri as well as Brest star Bradley Locko.

Arsenal have also been linked with Ait-Nouri over recent months after a series of impressive Premier League performances at Molineux.

The Algeria international is the Red Devils’ “preferred” target but Locko is “also of interest” ahead of the summer transfer window.

The France Under-23 international is valued by his Ligue 1 team at around the £17million mark.

Title: Wirtz in the league, if and when.
At some point, Wirtz probably moves on from Leverkusen. If he comes to the league, how would he do? He looks a bit small in physical stature and not overly pacy. He does have guile around the box, which would be useful against the parked buses. He would probably do well in Arsenal and Man City but not as well in Liverpool.

Title: Ange wants additions
Ange Postecoglou is desperate to strengthen his Tottenham squad this summer.

Spurs finished fifth during his first season in charge, missing out on the Champions League by just two points.

Ahead of the transfer window re-opening, [ESPN](https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/40184702/postecoglou-demands-3-tottenham-summer-transfers-sources) report that Postecoglou has asked for three new signings from the club.

Spurs made nine additions last summer before recruiting Radu Dragusin and Timo Werner in January.

From his time at feynoord, do you believe he's the right man for the Liverpool job? The expectations and the fanbase will be very high on him..

Title: Burnley fans should be furious with Kompany if he jumps to Bayern. He selfishly played a style that would appeal to the larger or elite clubs, while knowing Burnley did not have the talent to pull it off at the premier league level.
[https://www.skysports.com/football/live-blog/31771/12476234/transfer-centre-live-kompany-emerges-as-bayern-candidate](https://www.skysports.com/football/live-blog/31771/12476234/transfer-centre-live-kompany-emerges-as-bayern-candidate)

"**Burnley** manager **Vincent Kompany** has emerged as a candidate for the vacant **Bayern Munich** role, according to *Sky Germany*. 

Bayern have been focusing on a small group of potential new bosses from the Premier League and Kompany has been added to their list. 

Provisional talks have taken place between the two parties. 

Kompany was unable to keep Burnley in the Premier League this season having taken them up from the Championship. 

*Sky Germany* also say that **Hansi Flick**, **Erik ten Hag** and **Jose Mourinho** are no longer candidates. "

This proves my personal theory for why he was so stubborn in pretending he was coaching Man City when he had burnley level talent. He did not want to be view as the next Sean Dyche so he kept playing a highline and insisting on playing out from the back. He refused to be pragmatic (IMO) primarily to protect his image as a progressive football coach. He basically sacrificed burnley's premier league stint to ensure he would not have defensive pragmatic football associated with him.

Title: Unconventional End of Season Awards 
Yes every season you get your top goalscorer, young player of the year, most assists, manager of the year, player of the year and golden glove awards but .... here are some awards that I think we need to start having. 

1. If we have a young player of the season then I want to see a veteran of the season, someone who is at least 34 years old. 

2. Tackle of the season

3. Shithouse of the season (congrats Maupay on this one) 

4. Overreaction of the season

5. Limbs of the season - the award would be a sum of money that goes to the club to buy everyone in a stadium one drink each as a thank you. 

6. Skill of the season 

7. Rookie of the season - I love the idea of an award celebrating someone who has completed a debut season in the league, it could be youth players or a signing from a foreign league. 

8. Worst use of VAR of the season 

9. Best ref decision/use of VAR of the season. 

10. I really want there to be 10 but I can't think of another one unfortunately :( 

Let me know what you think would win in each category too.
